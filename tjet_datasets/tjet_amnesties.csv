Initially, the general amnesty law was for political prisoners, who were detained, convicted, or in jail because of political or related crimes. Those in prisoner were mostly leftist guerillas. The amnesty also covered exiles. There are not any mentioning of excluded crimes. On December 14, 1998, the Court of Appeals decided to apply this amnesty law to cover the military’s human rights violations. The Court of Appeals determined in a unanimous verdict that the military’s crimes were committed because of the unique situation the nation was undergoing. Despite the fact that the amnesty was extended to all citizens, in its preamble, the National Congress mentioned the cases of farmers, who according to criminal law were considered terrorists, although their only intention was to acquire land and was not an attempt against state security.

The military regime spent more than a year drafting up the law and its decree was delayed for several months due to disputes concerning its temporal and criminal jurisdictions. The legislation grants amnesty to military and government officials, who have committed political and related crimes. The regime used both television and radio outlets to advertise and endorse the amnesty. Opposition groups, trade unions, the Roman Catholic Church, and human rights NGOs opposed the amnesty. Although it pardoned military officials, many also opposed the amnesty because it gave the impression that they are responsible for or have actually committed crimes. On December 27, 1983, Congress repealed the amnesty legislation of the previous regime. Congress declared the amnesty law null and void. “This was possible because under a new conception of the validity of laws enacted by authoritarian governments, the law was treated as a de facto imposed norm which, as such, did not carry the presumption of validity enjoyed by norms of democratic origin. Therefore, it would be valid only if its content were just.” After just days of taking office, on December 10, 1983, President Alfonsín issued a decree that arrested high-ranking military officials for trial of the crimes they committed during the previous regime. The amnesty law covered all criminal activities related to or resulting from terrorist or subversive acts, but excludes members of illicit terrorist organizations. It only covers the period between June 17, 1982 (resignation of President Galtieri) and May 25, 1973 (return of the civilian government). June 1982 was a cut-off date to ensure that the then present military junta could not be held judicially accountable. This law also covers participants, instigators, accomplices, military and police members (Article 1). It even protests members of the paramilitary death squads, who kidnapped and killed hundreds of people under the approval of the military. The amnesty also covers international crimes, such as, crimes against humanity, stating: “'The penal actions arising from the crimes committed with terrorist or subversive motivation or objective between 25 May 1973 and 17 Jun 1982 shall be declared annulled. The benefits granted by this Law extend, in the same way, to all criminal activities resulting from or motivated by the development of actions directed at the avoidance, prevention or termination of the terrorist or subversive activities mentioned, whatever may have been their nature or the legal tenet violated” (Article 1). The amnesty excluded about 250 people, who had been charged with terrorist crimes by military and civilian courts. The amnesty also excluded economic crimes.",,1,"Excluded from the benefits provided in the preceding Article are members of illicit terrorist or subversive organisations who, on the date until which the benefits of the Law remain effective, do not reside legally and openly in the territory of the Argentine Nation or in places subject to its jurisdiction, or who have demonstrated by their conduct an intention to continue their connection with these organisations.",0,human rights crimes were included in amnesty,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"La ""loi de pacification nationale"" (loi n° 22.924) amnistie tous les membres des forces armées pour les crimes commis contre des organisations terroristes ou subversives entre le 25 mai 1973 et le 17 juin 1982.",human rights violations; armed opposition,rank and file,state agents,high ranking; low ranking,executive,,,Argentina,2024-12-15

According to ICTJ's analysis (2009: 33), the clause does not specify which acts would be covered by the amnesty. It only holds that it applies to “any act done in the execution of their respective duties.” This language could be interpreted widely to encompass administrative, civil, and criminal activities. Alternatively, it may be interpreted more restrictively, for example holding that any act done in violation of national or international law must, by definition, have been outside the scope of “their respective duties.” Such a restrictive interpretation of this immunity clause would permit criminal liability for severe human rights abuses. It is not clear whether the amnesty is intended to apply only to past actions or present and future actions. How these ambiguities are interpreted will likely depend on the new judiciary. It appears to be up to the national courts to decide that these serious crimes could not, by definition, have been part of an individual’s official duties because such acts violated Burma’s national laws, treaty obligations, or international law.

This legislation pardons political prisoners. Before the promulgation of this amnesty law, 99 prisoners were released on February 27, 1985, but 226 remained in jail. To advance the releasing of the remaining political prisoners, President Sanguinetti sent a ‘national pacification’ bill to Congress on March 1, 1985—the day of his inauguration. On March 5, 1985, the House of Representatives passed a blanket amnesty bill in a vote of 55-39, but the President opposed this type of amnesty, favoring a broad amnesty that excluded those of murder. After much debate, the House of Representatives concluded a final vote that passed the bill with 86 out of 91 votes. The bill was then sent to the Senate, which passed the bill by 24-3. The amnesty bill represents a compromise between Sanguinetti’s party and the opposition (Blanco Party) in which all political prisoners would be released, but the “special provisions for violenjt offenders were viewed as not condoning their actions.” This amnesty legislation authorized the releasing of all political prisoners within a three-month period. It covers common military crimes committed after January 1, 1962. It excluded those charged for violent crimes that needed to be reviewed in civilian courts and security forces members who were accused of human rights violations. It also excluded international crimes such as, murders and crimes committed by police or military officers, “who may have been perpetrators, co-perpetrators or accomplices in inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment, or in the detention of persons who subsequently disappeared, and about whom they may have concealed any of this behavior” (Article 5).

The Sandinista government did not want to support the amnesty provisions as detailed in the Arias Peace Plan.

The amnesty does not cover former members of the National Guard under the Somoza regime, who committed crimes against Nicaraguans because they were not sentenced under the Law on the maintenance of public order and security. Instead, they were trialed for violating a penal code that is not covered by the amnesty. Eventually, the amnesty was given to about 1,600 prisoners accused of Contra activity.

This amnesty was specifically created to pardon Ieng Sary. On August 19, 1979, Ieng Sary was convicted of genocide and other criems, and sentenced to death along with Pol Pot by the People’s Revolutionary Court of Phnom Penh in absentia. Thus, almost 20 years later, King Norodom Sihanouk gave out a royal decree giving amnesty to Ieng Sary, former Deputy Prime Minister of the Khmer Rouge government. The two former Co-Prime Ministers at the time—Prince Norodom Ranaridh (the King’s son), and Hun Sen (still Prime Minister of Cambodia) requested the amnesty for Ieng Sary. In exchange for recognizing the new coalition government with only Hun Sen leading as the sole Prime Minister, Ieng Sary was granted amnesty. He was excused of human rights violations and his convictions, and permitted to maintain control over a NW province called Pailin—a strong Khmer Rouge populated area. On October 5, 2004 during the negotiations of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, the Cambodian Parliament approved another law preventing the government from granting any amnesty or pardon to Khmer Rouge suspects. “Under this legislation, the tribunal also would have the authority to retroactively decide on the ‘scope’ of pardons granted before the tribunal law was adopted, in a measure apparently aimed at the pardon of Ieng Sary, the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister” (Mallinder Amnesty Law Database).",,0,"The amnesty was granted in return for Sarys defection from the Khmer Rouge, referred to the decree as the Democratic Kampuchea Group.",0,human rights crimes were included in amnesty,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,"Le roi Norodom Sihanouk a décrété une amnistie (décret royal n° NS?RKT/0996/72) en faveur de l'ancien vice-premier ministre des Khmers rouges, Ieng Sary, pour les violations flagrantes des droits de la personne commises pendant qu'il était en fonction.",human rights violations; armed opposition,not specified; leaders,state agents; armed opposition,high ranking,executive,300,644,Cambodia,2024-12-15

It was proposed by the President on June 27, 1979 and then approved by Congress on August 22, 1979. Finally, the President ratified it on August 28, 1979. The military opposed the amnesty law, but was forced to support it under pressure from the Brazilian Amnesty Committee and the amnesty movement that initiated in February 1978. The amnesty movement was supported by the lawyer’s organization, OAB, press association, the bishop’s conference, and other social and political organizations. It gained enough momentum for the President to act. This movement called for a broad, unrestricted amnesty, but in the end, the government compromised with an amnesty that did not release all political prisoners and would benefit security forces. Specifically, the amnesty would cover political crimes and violations of human rights committed by security forces between 1964 and 1979. In addition, “thousands of previously disenfranchised politicians were allowed to re-engage in politics in return for military impunity” (Mallinder Amnesty Law Database). It also covers employees of private businesses, who participated in demonstrations or public movement and were fired as a result of such participation. The amnesty also covers union members and representatives, who were dismissed from their jobs because of these participations. Although the amnesty legislation does not specifically claim that it covers torture, Brazilian judges have interpreted that it does. But according to the text, this amnesty covers political and related crimes that were committed by security force members or government employees between September 2, 1961 and August 15, 1979.

Amnesty Law No. 81 was passed on March 23, 1990 as a Presidential Decree. Nicaragua’s government passed this amnesty legislation in order to comply with the Arias Peace Plan of August 7, 1987. This amnesty is broad and unconditional for all Nicaraguans, meaning that it is not designated for the upper political class, but for any class of people. Article 1 grants amnesty to “all civilian and military Nicaraguans who may have committed infractions in the course of carrying out or investigating the criminal acts described in the preceding paragraph.” In other words, this amnesty excuses all governmental officials and army members, who may have broken the law or committed abuses in the past. This also covers economic crimes committed by government officials because of an occupational obligation. This amnesty applies to those who have been detained, awaiting trial, prosecuted, and in jail. The Sandinista government was hesitant to pardon those convicted and sentenced for human rights abuses and violations of humanitarian law. An agreement was reached in which the Commission would review “prisoners’ cases and distinguish between those in which notwithstanding the irregularities inherent in the Special Tribunals, there was overwhelming evidence of serious human rights violations, and those in which the evidence was insufficient to justify conviction. The Commission efficiently completed this review and recommended amnesty for the latter, and judicial review by Nicaragua’s regular courts for the former. The government, some months after receipt of the Commission’s report, freed most of the prisoners whose release the Commission recommended. Then, before leaving office, the Sandinistas freed all remaining political prisoners and made the amnesty complete by granting amnesty to all officials for the same crimes committed in public office.” (Mallinder Amnesty Law Database).",political prisoners,0,The 1991 law extended the amnesty period provided for in the May 1990 law until 22 Dec 1991.,0,human rights crimes were included in amnesty,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"La loi d'amnistie n° 81 prévoit une amnistie générale pour tous les Nicaraguayens ayant commis des crimes contre l'ordre et la sécurité de l'État, y compris des violations des droits de la personne et des actes de répression, entre le 19 juillet 1979 et le 13 mars 1990.",corruption or other economic crimes; human rights violations; armed opposition,rank and file; leaders,state agents; protesters / political prisoners; armed opposition,high ranking; low ranking,legislative act,,,Nicaragua,2024-12-15
