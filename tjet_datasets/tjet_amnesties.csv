These members were held in detention awaiting trial for these crimes or fugitives in exile. Some of the left-wing guerrilla leaders, who were pardoned, were Fernando Vaca Narvaja and Roberto Perdía. The pardon also covers those who were listed as “wanted” in some court cases, but who were also known to have disappeared after their detention in the course of the “dirty war.” However, President Menem also stated that the pardon will not covered any “subversives,” who had been charged in court. Due to international pressure, the pardon also does not cover Mario Eduardo Firmenich, who was the former leader of the Montoneros.

38,91,0,Decree No. 30-90-E provided full amnesty to all political prisoners and leftist guerrillas for political and associated common crimes and to members of the military for human rights violations committed during the 1980s,Decree 30 of 14 December 1990,1990,1990-12-05,"Ley Concediendo Amnistía, Decreto número 30-90 was implemented on December 5, 1990. Initially, the general amnesty law was for political prisoners, who were detained, convicted, or in jail because of political or related crimes. Those in prisoner were mostly leftist guerillas. The amnesty also covered exiles. There are not any mentioning of excluded crimes. On December 14, 1998, the Court of Appeals decided to apply this amnesty law to cover the military’s human rights violations. The Court of Appeals determined in a unanimous verdict that the military’s crimes were committed because of the unique situation the nation was undergoing. Despite the fact that the amnesty was extended to all citizens, in its preamble, the National Congress mentioned the cases of farmers, who according to criminal law were considered terrorists, although their only intention was to acquire land and was not an attempt against state security. Article 3 stated that foreigners could benefit but they must leave the territory within a reasonable period of time (GLIN 1990). On 14 December 1998, the Court of Appeals decided to extend this amnesty to cover human rights violations by the military. The unanimous verdict by the Court ruled that the amnesty also covered the military since their crimes were committed in the 'special situation' the nation was undergoing at the time (Mallinder).",,0,,0,human rights crimes are not relevant to this amnesty,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Amnesty International, Honduras: Continued struggle against impunity, AMR37/01/96, March 1996.

Decreto Ley 2191,1978,1978-04-19,"The Chilean Amnesty Act of 1978 is also known as the Pinochet Amnesty Act. It was drafted in 1978 by Pinochet’s regime and promulgated on April 18, 1978 as Executive Decree No. 2,191. It was created to minimize the regime’s exposure to judicial accountability. Articles 1 and 2 provide blanket amnesty for all offences committed under the 1973’s State of Siege. However, the Decree also gives plenty of exceptions to make sure that broader amnesty would not be granted if not completely necessary. One of the significant exceptions is Article 1, which denies amnesty to anyone currently on trial or serving a sentence, which in practice translates to anyone the junta has decided to prosecute.

The military regime spent more than a year drafting up the law and its decree was delayed for several months due to disputes concerning its temporal and criminal jurisdictions. The legislation grants amnesty to military and government officials, who have committed political and related crimes. The regime used both television and radio outlets to advertise and endorse the amnesty. Opposition groups, trade unions, the Roman Catholic Church, and human rights NGOs opposed the amnesty. Although it pardoned military officials, many also opposed the amnesty because it gave the impression that they are responsible for or have actually committed crimes. On December 27, 1983, Congress repealed the amnesty legislation of the previous regime. Congress declared the amnesty law null and void. “This was possible because under a new conception of the validity of laws enacted by authoritarian governments, the law was treated as a de facto imposed norm which, as such, did not carry the presumption of validity enjoyed by norms of democratic origin. Therefore, it would be valid only if its content were just.” After just days of taking office, on December 10, 1983, President Alfonsín issued a decree that arrested high-ranking military officials for trial of the crimes they committed during the previous regime. The amnesty law covered all criminal activities related to or resulting from terrorist or subversive acts, but excludes members of illicit terrorist organizations. It only covers the period between June 17, 1982 (resignation of President Galtieri) and May 25, 1973 (return of the civilian government). June 1982 was a cut-off date to ensure that the then present military junta could not be held judicially accountable. This law also covers participants, instigators, accomplices, military and police members (Article 1).

The amnesty provision is contain in the new 2008 Constitution, Article 445 in Chapter 14 entitled 'Transitory Provisions' of the Constitutions states: 'No proceeding shall be instituted against the said Councils or any member thereof or any member of the Government, in respect of any act done in the execution of their respective duties.' According to ICTJ's analysis (2009: 33), the clause does not specify which acts would be covered by the amnesty. It only holds that it applies to “any act done in the execution of their respective duties.” This language could be interpreted widely to encompass administrative, civil, and criminal activities. Alternatively, it may be interpreted more restrictively, for example holding that any act done in violation of national or international law must, by definition, have been outside the scope of “their respective duties.” Such a restrictive interpretation of this immunity clause would permit criminal liability for severe human rights abuses. It is not clear whether the amnesty is intended to apply only to past actions or present and future actions. How these ambiguities are interpreted will likely depend on the new judiciary. It appears to be up to the national courts to decide that these serious crimes could not, by definition, have been part of an individual’s official duties because such acts violated Burma’s national laws, treaty obligations, or international law. Such a position appears unlikely, however, in the current context in which the Burmese courts function as an extension of military rule (ICTJ 2009: 37).

The amnesty was broad and provided pardons for government officials who committed even common crimes to try to suppress the rebel group. The text of the amnesty has been interpreted to provide more protection for government officials than it does to rebels. State officials are immune from “penal responsibility for common crimes committed with the aim of impeding, frustrating, suppressing, or punishing the commission of political acts.” Rebels were granted amnesty to political crimes such as, sedition, illicit association, crimes against national security, and weapons-related crimes. The amnesty leaves extrajudicial killings by security forces and deliberate and arbitrary killings by the rebels open to the interpretation of the courts. It excludes international crimes for which Guatemala is a party to and serious human rights violation, such as genocide, torture, and forced disappearance (Article 8). It also excludes any crime that demonstrates personal motive (Article 3).

This legislation pardons political prisoners. Before the promulgation of this amnesty law, 99 prisoners were released on February 27, 1985, but 226 remained in jail. To advance the releasing of the remaining political prisoners, President Sanguinetti sent a ‘national pacification’ bill to Congress on March 1, 1985—the day of his inauguration. On March 5, 1985, the House of Representatives passed a blanket amnesty bill in a vote of 55-39, but the President opposed this type of amnesty, favoring a broad amnesty that excluded those of murder. After much debate, the House of Representatives concluded a final vote that passed the bill with 86 out of 91 votes. The bill was then sent to the Senate, which passed the bill by 24-3. The amnesty bill represents a compromise between Sanguinetti’s party and the opposition (Blanco Party) in which all political prisoners would be released, but the “special provisions for violenjt offenders were viewed as not condoning their actions.” This amnesty legislation authorized the releasing of all political prisoners within a three-month period. It covers common military crimes committed after January 1, 1962. It excluded those charged for violent crimes that needed to be reviewed in civilian courts and security forces members who were accused of human rights violations. It also excluded international crimes such as, murders and crimes committed by police or military officers, “who may have been perpetrators, co-perpetrators or accomplices in inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment, or in the detention of persons who subsequently disappeared, and about whom they may have concealed any of this behavior” (Article 5).

The Legislative Assembly approved this amnesty law with 33 votes from the Christian Democrats (government party) and 27 abstaining votes from the opposition party, who refused to vote because they did not agree with the bill’s provisions. The legislation also garnered 21 cotes from the conservative party—the National Conciliation Party. Thus, the final vote was 45-0 in a 60-seat assembly. Human rights groups and insurgents did not support this bill. The legislation received pressure from the military to cover all political crimes so that the crimes of military members and death squads were covered. Article 1 of the legislation details the beneficiaries of the full amnesty, which includes national or foreigners, who were directly or indirectly involved in political or related common crimes committed on or before October 22, 1987, in which the number of participants is no less than 20. As a result, about 750 political prisoners, who were awaiting trial, were freed. The amnesty excludes crimes, such as, kidnapping, extortion, drug-related crimes, and economic crimes.

The Sandinista government did not want to support the amnesty provisions as detailed in the Arias Peace Plan. There was a strong push from the human rights sector and inter-governmental organizations to get the amnesty through. The National Assembly passed the amnesty law on November 19, 1987. The amnesty law pardons Nicaraguans, who had been convicted and sentenced for violating laws regarding public order and security from July 20, 1979. The amnesty does not cover former members of the National Guard under the Somoza regime, who committed crimes against Nicaraguans because they were not sentenced under the Law on the maintenance of public order and security. Instead, they were trialed for violating a penal code that is not covered by the amnesty. Eventually, the amnesty was given to about 1,600 prisoners accused of Contra activity. The Sandinista government timed the releasing of these prisoners with funding decisions that US Congress made.

This amnesty was specifically created to pardon Ieng Sary. On August 19, 1979, Ieng Sary was convicted of genocide and other criems, and sentenced to death along with Pol Pot by the People’s Revolutionary Court of Phnom Penh in absentia. Thus, almost 20 years later, King Norodom Sihanouk gave out a royal decree giving amnesty to Ieng Sary, former Deputy Prime Minister of the Khmer Rouge government. The two former Co-Prime Ministers at the time—Prince Norodom Ranaridh (the King’s son), and Hun Sen (still Prime Minister of Cambodia) requested the amnesty for Ieng Sary. In exchange for recognizing the new coalition government with only Hun Sen leading as the sole Prime Minister, Ieng Sary was granted amnesty. He was excused of human rights violations and his convictions, and permitted to maintain control over a NW province called Pailin—a strong Khmer Rouge populated area. On October 5, 2004 during the negotiations of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, the Cambodian Parliament approved another law preventing the government from granting any amnesty or pardon to Khmer Rouge suspects. “Under this legislation, the tribunal also would have the authority to retroactively decide on the ‘scope’ of pardons granted before the tribunal law was adopted, in a measure apparently aimed at the pardon of Ieng Sary, the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister” (Mallinder Amnesty Law Database).",,0,"The amnesty was granted in return for Sarys defection from the Khmer Rouge, referred to the decree as the Democratic Kampuchea Group.",0,human rights crimes were included in amnesty,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,"AI 2009.

Hassan Bouba, the political coordinator for Union for Peace in the Central African Republic, said that a general amnesty was implicit in the accord.

This amnesty relates to human rights crimes committed by the military government (the Armed Forces) in power in Uruguay from August 1984 to March 1, 1985. During this time, the government pursued a systematic policy of repression and eliminated oppositions of the government through forced disappearance [pg. 8]. This amnesty covers military and police officials who received order(s) from their superiors and carried them out for political reasons or to fulfill their occupation obligations. It does not cover judicial proceedings in which the indictments have been released before this amnesty law goes into effect. Pending cases can be submitted to the Executive branch to determine if it falls within the scope of the amnesty law. This amnesty also does not cover crimes that were committed for personal economic advantage or to benefit a third party. This amnesty law is incompatible with the American Convention on Human Rights, which Uruguay is a party to. When it comes to prosecuting crimes during this period, the Uruguayan government has claimed that it is unable to because the previous democratic government approved this law.

The restricted amnesty covers any accused of political crimes or related acts, and for those who took part in common crimes committed by at least 20 people prior to December 31, 1991. The amnesty does not cover those who have been convicted by juries, which is a specific clause created to officers, who were convicted for murder of 6 Jesuit priests. Anyone mentioned in the Truth Commission Report will not covered by the amnesty because the crimes they committed represented grave acts of violence. The amnesty law is allowed to grant pardons for both criminal and civil proceedings. “The law that takes effect on 1 Feb 1992, declares a general amnesty for all but those people who have been convicted by a civilian court - an exemption that prevents the immediate release of two army officers convicted of killing six Jesuit priests in Nov 1989. A limited amnesty was passed by the legislature in 1992 on the heels of the peace accords. Excepted from its terms were those cases within the mandate of the Truth Commission (although which cases would be addressed by the commission had not yet been determined).

It was proposed by the President on June 27, 1979 and then approved by Congress on August 22, 1979. Finally, the President ratified it on August 28, 1979. The military opposed the amnesty law, but was forced to support it under pressure from the Brazilian Amnesty Committee and the amnesty movement that initiated in February 1978. The amnesty movement was supported by the lawyer’s organization, OAB, press association, the bishop’s conference, and other social and political organizations. It gained enough momentum for the President to act. This movement called for a broad, unrestricted amnesty, but in the end, the government compromised with an amnesty that did not release all political prisoners and would benefit security forces. Specifically, the amnesty would cover political crimes and violations of human rights committed by security forces between 1964 and 1979. In addition, “thousands of previously disenfranchised politicians were allowed to re-engage in politics in return for military impunity” (Mallinder Amnesty Law Database). It also covers employees of private businesses, who participated in demonstrations or public movement and were fired as a result of such participation. The amnesty also covers union members and representatives, who were dismissed from their jobs because of these participations. Although the amnesty legislation does not specifically claim that it covers torture, Brazilian judges have interpreted that it does. But according to the text, this amnesty covers political and related crimes that were committed by security force members or government employees between September 2, 1961 and August 15, 1979.

Amnesty Law No. 81 was passed on March 23, 1990 as a Presidential Decree. Nicaragua’s government passed this amnesty legislation in order to comply with the Arias Peace Plan of August 7, 1987. This amnesty is broad and unconditional for all Nicaraguans, meaning that it is not designated for the upper political class, but for any class of people. Article 1 grants amnesty to “all civilian and military Nicaraguans who may have committed infractions in the course of carrying out or investigating the criminal acts described in the preceding paragraph.” In other words, this amnesty excuses all governmental officials and army members, who may have broken the law or committed abuses in the past. This also covers economic crimes committed by government officials because of an occupational obligation. This amnesty applies to those who have been detained, awaiting trial, prosecuted, and in jail. The Sandinista government was hesitant to pardon those convicted and sentenced for human rights abuses and violations of humanitarian law. An agreement was reached in which the Commission would review “prisoners’ cases and distinguish between those in which notwithstanding the irregularities inherent in the Special Tribunals, there was overwhelming evidence of serious human rights violations, and those in which the evidence was insufficient to justify conviction. The Commission efficiently completed this review and recommended amnesty for the latter, and judicial review by Nicaragua’s regular courts for the former. The government, some months after receipt of the Commission’s report, freed most of the prisoners whose release the Commission recommended.
