The military regime spent more than a year drafting up the law and its decree was delayed for several months due to disputes concerning its temporal and criminal jurisdictions. The legislation grants amnesty to military and government officials, who have committed political and related crimes. The regime used both television and radio outlets to advertise and endorse the amnesty. Opposition groups, trade unions, the Roman Catholic Church, and human rights NGOs opposed the amnesty. Although it pardoned military officials, many also opposed the amnesty because it gave the impression that they are responsible for or have actually committed crimes. On December 27, 1983, Congress repealed the amnesty legislation of the previous regime. Congress declared the amnesty law null and void. “This was possible because under a new conception of the validity of laws enacted by authoritarian governments, the law was treated as a de facto imposed norm which, as such, did not carry the presumption of validity enjoyed by norms of democratic origin. Therefore, it would be valid only if its content were just.” After just days of taking office, on December 10, 1983, President Alfonsín issued a decree that arrested high-ranking military officials for trial of the crimes they committed during the previous regime. The amnesty law covered all criminal activities related to or resulting from terrorist or subversive acts, but excludes members of illicit terrorist organizations. It only covers the period between June 17, 1982 (resignation of President Galtieri) and May 25, 1973 (return of the civilian government). June 1982 was a cut-off date to ensure that the then present military junta could not be held judicially accountable. This law also covers participants, instigators, accomplices, military and police members (Article 1). It even protests members of the paramilitary death squads, who kidnapped and killed hundreds of people under the approval of the military. The amnesty also covers international crimes, such as, crimes against humanity, stating: “'The penal actions arising from the crimes committed with terrorist or subversive motivation or objective between 25 May 1973 and 17 Jun 1982 shall be declared annulled. The benefits granted by this Law extend, in the same way, to all criminal activities resulting from or motivated by the development of actions directed at the avoidance, prevention or termination of the terrorist or subversive activities mentioned, whatever may have been their nature or the legal tenet violated” (Article 1).

The military opposed the amnesty law, but was forced to support it under pressure from the Brazilian Amnesty Committee and the amnesty movement that initiated in February 1978. The amnesty movement was supported by the lawyer’s organization, OAB, press association, the bishop’s conference, and other social and political organizations. It gained enough momentum for the President to act. This movement called for a broad, unrestricted amnesty, but in the end, the government compromised with an amnesty that did not release all political prisoners and would benefit security forces. Specifically, the amnesty would cover political crimes and violations of human rights committed by security forces between 1964 and 1979. In addition, “thousands of previously disenfranchised politicians were allowed to re-engage in politics in return for military impunity” (Mallinder Amnesty Law Database). It also covers employees of private businesses, who participated in demonstrations or public movement and were fired as a result of such participation. The amnesty also covers union members and representatives, who were dismissed from their jobs because of these participations. Although the amnesty legislation does not specifically claim that it covers torture, Brazilian judges have interpreted that it does. But according to the text, this amnesty covers political and related crimes that were committed by security force members or government employees between September 2, 1961 and August 15, 1979.

However, the amnesty does not cover “leaders” of the Khmer Rouge and the term “leader” is not defined in the legislation.

On August 19, 1979, Ieng Sary was convicted of genocide and other criems, and sentenced to death along with Pol Pot by the People’s Revolutionary Court of Phnom Penh in absentia. Thus, almost 20 years later, King Norodom Sihanouk gave out a royal decree giving amnesty to Ieng Sary, former Deputy Prime Minister of the Khmer Rouge government. The two former Co-Prime Ministers at the time—Prince Norodom Ranaridh (the King’s son), and Hun Sen (still Prime Minister of Cambodia) requested the amnesty for Ieng Sary. In exchange for recognizing the new coalition government with only Hun Sen leading as the sole Prime Minister, Ieng Sary was granted amnesty. He was excused of human rights violations and his convictions, and permitted to maintain control over a NW province called Pailin—a strong Khmer Rouge populated area. On October 5, 2004 during the negotiations of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, the Cambodian Parliament approved another law preventing the government from granting any amnesty or pardon to Khmer Rouge suspects. “Under this legislation, the tribunal also would have the authority to retroactively decide on the ‘scope’ of pardons granted before the tribunal law was adopted, in a measure apparently aimed at the pardon of Ieng Sary, the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister” (Mallinder Amnesty Law Database).",state agents; armed opposition,high ranking,not specified; leaders,0,"The amnesty was granted in return for Sarys defection from the Khmer Rouge, referred to the decree as the Democratic Kampuchea Group.",human rights violations; armed opposition,0,human rights crimes were included in amnesty,0,0,0,1,1,300,644,1,0,0,0,2025-11-16

The amnesty provision is contain in the new 2008 Constitution, Article 445 in Chapter 14 entitled 'Transitory Provisions' of the Constitutions states: 'No proceeding shall be instituted against the said Councils or any member thereof or any member of the Government, in respect of any act done in the execution of their respective duties.' According to ICTJ's analysis (2009: 33), the clause does not specify which acts would be covered by the amnesty. It only holds that it applies to “any act done in the execution of their respective duties.” This language could be interpreted widely to encompass administrative, civil, and criminal activities. Alternatively, it may be interpreted more restrictively, for example holding that any act done in violation of national or international law must, by definition, have been outside the scope of “their respective duties.” Such a restrictive interpretation of this immunity clause would permit criminal liability for severe human rights abuses. It is not clear whether the amnesty is intended to apply only to past actions or present and future actions. How these ambiguities are interpreted will likely depend on the new judiciary. It appears to be up to the national courts to decide that these serious crimes could not, by definition, have been part of an individual’s official duties because such acts violated Burma’s national laws, treaty obligations, or international law. Such a position appears unlikely, however, in the current context in which the Burmese courts function as an extension of military rule (ICTJ 2009: 37).

Amnesty Law No. 81 was passed on March 23, 1990 as a Presidential Decree. Nicaragua’s government passed this amnesty legislation in order to comply with the Arias Peace Plan of August 7, 1987. This amnesty is broad and unconditional for all Nicaraguans, meaning that it is not designated for the upper political class, but for any class of people. Article 1 grants amnesty to “all civilian and military Nicaraguans who may have committed infractions in the course of carrying out or investigating the criminal acts described in the preceding paragraph.” In other words, this amnesty excuses all governmental officials and army members, who may have broken the law or committed abuses in the past. This also covers economic crimes committed by government officials because of an occupational obligation. This amnesty applies to those who have been detained, awaiting trial, prosecuted, and in jail. The Sandinista government was hesitant to pardon those convicted and sentenced for human rights abuses and violations of humanitarian law. An agreement was reached in which the Commission would review “prisoners’ cases and distinguish between those in which notwithstanding the irregularities inherent in the Special Tribunals, there was overwhelming evidence of serious human rights violations, and those in which the evidence was insufficient to justify conviction. The Commission efficiently completed this review and recommended amnesty for the latter, and judicial review by Nicaragua’s regular courts for the former. The government, some months after receipt of the Commission’s report, freed most of the prisoners whose release the Commission recommended. Then, before leaving office, the Sandinistas freed all remaining political prisoners and made the amnesty complete by granting amnesty to all officials for the same crimes committed in public office.” (Mallinder Amnesty Law Database).",state agents; protesters / political prisoners; armed opposition,high ranking; low ranking,rank and file; leaders,0,The 1991 law extended the amnesty period provided for in the May 1990 law until 22 Dec 1991.,corruption or other economic crimes; human rights violations; armed opposition,0,human rights crimes were included in amnesty,0,1,0,1,0,,,0,0,0,0,2025-11-16

This legislation pardons political prisoners. Before the promulgation of this amnesty law, 99 prisoners were released on February 27, 1985, but 226 remained in jail. To advance the releasing of the remaining political prisoners, President Sanguinetti sent a ‘national pacification’ bill to Congress on March 1, 1985—the day of his inauguration. On March 5, 1985, the House of Representatives passed a blanket amnesty bill in a vote of 55-39, but the President opposed this type of amnesty, favoring a broad amnesty that excluded those of murder. After much debate, the House of Representatives concluded a final vote that passed the bill with 86 out of 91 votes. The bill was then sent to the Senate, which passed the bill by 24-3. The amnesty bill represents a compromise between Sanguinetti’s party and the opposition (Blanco Party) in which all political prisoners would be released, but the “special provisions for violenjt offenders were viewed as not condoning their actions.” This amnesty legislation authorized the releasing of all political prisoners within a three-month period. It covers common military crimes committed after January 1, 1962. It excluded those charged for violent crimes that needed to be reviewed in civilian courts and security forces members who were accused of human rights violations.

This amnesty relates to human rights crimes committed by the military government (the Armed Forces) in power in Uruguay from August 1984 to March 1, 1985. During this time, the government pursued a systematic policy of repression and eliminated oppositions of the government through forced disappearance [pg. 8]. This amnesty covers military and police officials who received order(s) from their superiors and carried them out for political reasons or to fulfill their occupation obligations. It does not cover judicial proceedings in which the indictments have been released before this amnesty law goes into effect. Pending cases can be submitted to the Executive branch to determine if it falls within the scope of the amnesty law. This amnesty also does not cover crimes that were committed for personal economic advantage or to benefit a third party. This amnesty law is incompatible with the American Convention on Human Rights, which Uruguay is a party to. When it comes to prosecuting crimes during this period, the Uruguayan government has claimed that it is unable to because the previous democratic government approved this law.
