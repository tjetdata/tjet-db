1,,Afghanistan,700,2004,2005,Constitutional ban on electoral candidates,Interdiction constitutionnelle des candidats aux élections,,"In November 2003, following the defeat of the Taliban government by U.S. forces, a 35-member committee drafted a new constitution for Afghanistan. In 2004, the draft was debated and approved by an ad-hoc assembly (""loya jirga"") of approximately 500 members (Katzman 2013, 6). According to the new constitution, individuals convicted of crimes against humanity are ineligible to hold the offices of the President, executive ministers, the National Assembly, and the Supreme Court (articles 62, 72, 85, 118). Additionally, a 2005 presidential decree extended the restrictions in Article 85 (the National Assembly) to provincial- and district-level elections (Ayub et. al. 2009, 15). Because of ""the lack of a functioning and independent judiciary,"" the constitutional exclusion of those convicted of crimes against humanity had no practical effect on the 2004/2005 election process in Afghanistan, nor was it expected to impact the 2010 elections (Ayub et. al. 2009, 15; Grossman 2009, 29). In an attempt to overcome this flaw, a separate vetting policy was implemented for the 2005 parliamentary elections.",0,1,0,"public sector employee (bureaucrats, low-rank nominated or elected officials); legislature; executive; judiciary",constitutional act,specific individual conduct,,,,,0,0,1,1,333,735,0,0,2025-07-22

Widespread concern existed that the elections could be undermined by the threat of force by non-state militias or similar groups. Additionally, pressure existed from international NGOs and the Afghan public to exclude human rights violators from public office (Ayub et. al. 2009, 18). While the Constitution of Afghanistan prevents anyone convicted of human rights violations from running for office, the weak state of the Afghan judiciary rendered that exclusion irrelevant. Ultimately, the Afghan government decreed that candidates would be excluded if they had ties to illegal armed groups (IAGs) that had not been dismantled, ""with the understanding that success in this area had some bearing on human rights protection"" (Grossman 2009, 29-30). The Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) examined challenges against the eligibility of individual candidates. These challenges were filed both by organizations and ordinary citizens. In addition to reviewing these challenges, the ECC checked candidates against a list prepared by the Disarmament and Reintegration Commission, which had already been working to dismantle IAGs and thus had relevant data on participation. In practice, ""the majority of the 1,144 challenges...had to do with human rights violations and war crimes."" Alleged crimes covered a timespan from 1978 until the elections, with many complaints stemming from the period of the 1990s when implicated individuals were in political power (Ayub et al. 2009, 34). Approximately 200 candidates were disqualified by the ECC on the basis of ties to IAGs. These individuals were notified and given the opportunity to respond to the exclusion, including the opportunity to be reinstated as candidates after disarming and disbanding their IAGs. This mechanism functioned as a sort of appeals process. Approximately 150 individuals demonstrated compliance with the disarmament request and regained eligibility (Ayub et al. 2009, 24-25). The effectiveness of the vetting process was questioned on several fronts. Most notably, vetting was a closed process that still allowed many individuals with ties to IAGs to participate, either because they were never excluded or because their eligibility was restored on the basis of a promise of future compliance. Moreover, the ECC and other agencies involved lacked adequate resources, and the project was compressed into a short timescale (Ayub et al. 2009, 25-34). The election body charged with verifying candidate eligibility did not participate in the vetting process for the 2009 election, effectively moving the responsibility for candidate vetting to a different election body, which did not have enough time to complete the in-depth interviews required by the vetting process.",0,1,0,"public sector employee (bureaucrats, low-rank nominated or elected officials)",executive,specific individual conduct,no,yes,"The International Crisis Group report has noted he exchange of information about people implicated in such activities went on “behind closed doors.” The process was highly politicized; if any of the JS member agencies wanted to make sure that a candidate was not disqualified, that agency would either not give information about the candidate’s links to illegal groups, or would cite security reasons for not disqualifying the candidate despite evidence of links to IAGs.97 Thus, the objective assessment of the candidates’ compliance with the disarmament process was not the deciding factor. Even candidates listed for disqualification could be reinstated if one of the JS member agencies identified them as posing a security risk if they were excluded. This became a highly selective vetting process.",don't know,0,0,1,1,333,735,0,0,2025-07-22

On November 30, the Assembly adopted Law 8043 on the Verification of the Moral Character of Officials and other Persons Connected with the Defense of the Democratic State (the Verification Law). These laws constitute Albania's 1995 vetting and lustration policies. The genocide law includes language specifically in response to past human rights abuses; after a 1997 amendment, both laws included provisions about crimes against humanity (Ballauri and Imholz 2005, 40). The Genocide Law prohibited persons with ties to the communist regime prior to 31 March 1991 from holding selected positions in the government, parliament, judiciary, or mass media until the year 2002. It applied to former members of the Politburo and Central Committee, ministers, parliamentary deputies, presidents of the Supreme Court, former Secret Police agents and informers. The Verification Law provided for the screening of potential and actual members of the government, police, judiciary, educational system, and media in order to determine affiliations with communist era government organs and/or state police. The law created a seven-member commission, consisting of the chairman, deputy chairman and five members, who were to be honourable citizens in good standing and not Members of Parliament. The Parliament had the right to name and remove the chairman, while the deputy chairman and one member were to be named and removed by the Council of Ministers, and one member each by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior [Public Order], the Ministry of Defence and the National [State] Information Service. The committee was appointed by the government in power and tended to carry out reviews in secret, raising concerns with human-rights NGOs such as Helsinki Watch that the process was vulnerable to political manipulation (Austin and Ellison 2009, 187-189). The law authorized exclusive use of secret police files to screen potential and actual members of the government, police, judiciary, educational system, and media for affiliations with the communist era government and/or state police. Candidates could not run for elected office without clearance from the Commission. The law provided for direct appeal to the Court of Cassation, the highest court in Albania. However, only 57 cases were appealed and 7 overturned. The Commission barred 139 people from participating in the 1996 elections.

The military rule of Gen. Luis Garcia Meza has been described as “ruthless”, with over 500 people victims who were either forcefully disappeared, killed, or tortured. The regime and those who presided over it were driven by the drug-trade, as Bolivia was a key hotspot for the production and trafficking of cocaine. As the coup had no international funding or backing, the Minister of the Interior at the time, Luis Arce Gómez, had apparently managed the trade of drugs as a way to finance the coup and the continued power of Gen. Luis Garcia Meza. The regime ended in August of 1981 with the resignation of Luis Garcia Meza, with power being transferred to another military member, Guido Vildoso. Vildoso later provided the first ever peaceful transfer of power to Hernán Siles Zuazo. Following his return to Bolivia from exile, Zauzo announced that members of the military that contributed to gross human rights violations, the destruction of democratic values, and the trafficking of narcotics during the military coup would be purged. Starting in 1982, military honour tribunals had discharged 23 army officers, including General Luis Garcia Meza, the leader of the coup, as well as the commanders of the air and navy service who were under his command.

Luis Cossio Viruez, former operations chief of the military-run National Council against Narcotics Trafficking, and Col.

9,,Bosnia and Herzegovina,346,1995,1995,Dayton Agreement,Accord de Dayton,1995-12-14,"On 14 December 1995, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Republic of Bosnia and Herzgovina, and the Republic of Croatia signed the Dayton Agreement through a treaty process. The Agreement includes several vetting and lustration provisions. First, it bars individuals serving a sentence imposed by the ICTY or under indictment by the ICTY from running for or holding office. A loophole in this ban permits formerly convicted individuals and unindicted individuals suspected of war crimes to run for and hold public office. A report from the International Crisis Group names individuals in eighteen Republika Srpska municipalities and the Brcko District who are alleged to have committed or supervised indictable acts, and are therefore potentially indictable for war crimes under the criteria issued by the ICTY. However, they continue to work in the police force, hold public office, exercise power through the legal and illegal economy, or influence politics Second, the Dayton Agreement requires dismissal or prosecution of police officers and public servants responsible for ""serious violations of minority rights."" In December 1996, the UN Security Council passed UNSCR 1088, establishing United Nations Mission In Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) to conduct investigations of police who had committed abuse. From November 1999-2000, the UNMIBH required all police personnel to register for certification to continue their service. The UNMIHB denied certification to individuals with criminal records, indictments, or previous removal by the UNMIHB. Those denied certification appeal the denial through an unspecified review process. UNMIBH’s mandate and the certification law came to a close in December 2002. In the Course of the certification process, UNMIBH registered and screened all 23, 751 Ministry of Interior personnel who presented themselves to the registration teams. Third, the Dayton Agreement empowered the Office of the High Representative (OHR, the international body that oversaw the implementation of the civilian aspects of the Dayton Agreement) to remove civil servants from public office for reasons ranging from their wartime record to obstructing the implementation of the peace process.

""The types of cases reviewed included, inter alia, police officers who were guards or interrogators in concentration camps and took part in ill-treatment of prisoners; commanders of military police units that operated detention facilities where atrocities occurred; and officers were directly involved in war crimes or crimes against humanity including murder, rape, torture, and ill-treatment during the conflict""(Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 190). According to the Dayton Peace Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina consisted of two equal entities: The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska (RS) (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 185). In 1998, the restructuring agreement was also signed by the RS, authorizing the UNMIBH to vet police based on a three-step personnel reform process: registration, provisional authorization, and certification (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg, 188). From November 1999 to December 2000, UNMIBH registered all Ministry of the Interior personnel who presented themselves in the registration process, which included information on qualifications, current assignment, professional history and background. The Local Police Registry Section was established by the Human Rights Office of the UNMIBH (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 188). During the provisional authorization, registered people had to undergo an initial screening process to remove those who did not meet the minimum criteria for service (minimum age, citizenship, minimal training requirements, and a position requiring the exercise of police powers). ""Circumstances that precluded provisional authorization were, inter alia, a criminal record or indictment or previous removal by UNMIBH""(Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 189). Those who met the criteria were authorized to exercise police powers and were given an UNMIBH identification card (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 189). Those certified were subjected to even more extensive background checks and performance monitoring. Those who passed received full certification from the UNMIBH, which was decided by the UNMIBH police commissioner (Mayer-Reickh, 2007, pg 189). A police officer who was not certified could no longer exercise police powers (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 190). If someone was denied certification, they could request a review of his or her case, yet there were no specific steps to this process. In 2002, an international UNMIBH panel was created, independent of the UNMIBH police commissioner. This panel reviewed submissions and could refer cases back to the commissioner for reconsideration, who had the final decision (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 190-1). March 2004, over one hundred fifty noncertified police officers asked domestic courts to review their dismissals. Some courts believed that they had no jurisdiction over UNMIBH decisions. Other courts issued judgments declaring such dismissals unlawful and reinstating police officers that were not certified by UNMIBH (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 194). In February 2007, the Human Rights Ministry established a commission to review the dismissals and report to the newly formed government (Stan, Nedelsky, 2013, pg 64). UNMIBH's mandate and the certification law came to a close in December 2002. In the Course of the certification process, UNMIBH registered and screened all 23,751 Ministry of Interior personnel who presented themselves to the registration teams.

This policy declares mainly in Article 3 the requirement that ""only those individuals may hold positions in the executive bodies of scientific organizations and the Higher Certifying Commission who can show that they"" have met many numerous requirements. Those that held positions at such institutions during the law's enactment must also submit a statement regarding their prior employment; if they refuse, it will be taken as failing one or more of the listed requirements for employment (Kritz, 701, 1995). The ban of academic members was set to only last through 1997, and there is no known appeals process (Kritz, 701, 1995). This law, though, did face opponents. President Zhelev, after signing the bill, joined 102 members of the National Assembly in petitioning the Constitutional Court to rule on the constitutionality of many other articles throughout the law (Helsinki, 10-13, 1993). On February 19th, 1993, the Constitutional Court found in a six to five decision that the law does not violate the Constitution, ""…defining the provisions of the law as merely 'additional requirements'"" (Helsinki, 11, 1993). However, in 1995, the law was repealed when the Socialist Party of Bulgaria (BSP) won an absolute majority in the elections. (Sadurski, 248, 2005). It must be noted that throughout the whole time of its implementation, only one institution had not acted on this law: the History Department at Sofia University. (Kritz, 704, 1995). The Panev Law was essentially self implemented, as candidates withdrew themselves from consideration, and university administrations removed compromised individuals from their institutions. The law ""had a direct impact on the ability of academic bodies to determine… who their leaders will be"" (Helsinki, 13, 1993). However, the law was repealed in 1995 after the 1994 elections resulted in an absolute majority by the Socialist Party of Bulgaria (BSP) (Sadursky, 248, 2005).

14,,Bulgaria,355,1992,1992,Law on Banks and Credit Activity,Loi sur les banques et l'activité de crédit,1992-03-18,"On 18 March 1992, the Bulgarian Parliament adopted ""Transitional and Concluding Provisions of the Law for Banks and Credit"" through legislation. The law included a provision for lustrating members of the former Communist regime (Ellis, 188, 1996). Although numerous human rights violations occurred under the previous regime, it is unclear whether or not the lustration provision in the Banking Law was motivated by past abuses or political reasons. At least one source suggests that lustration in the Banking Law was part of the broader electoral strategy of the anticommunist UDF party (Kolarova 1996). This policy is an act of banning from future employment in the banking system those with membership or affiliation with the past Communist regime. Targeted individuals included those who had been members of the Communist Party and various affiliated political groups, such as trade unions, as well as former employees and collaborators with security forces. These individuals were banned from being elected or appointed to ""executive positions"" in banks. The ban would have been in effect for five years (Helsinki Watch, 5-6, 1993; The Economist, 2007). The ban, however, had been set up to last for only five years (Helsinki Watch, 5-6, 1993). There is no known appeals process, and the life of this law was short only lasting from its passing on March 4, 1992 to the court's ruling on June 12, 1992. Forty-nine members of the National Assembly submitted a petition for the Constitutional Court to rule on its constitutionality, arguing that ""'All citizens shall be equal before the law. There shall be no privileges or restrictions of rights on the grounds of. . . opinion, political affiliation . . .' (and that) The petition also challenged the Banking Law as a violation of international human rights documents which are considered part of Bulgaria's domestic legislation,"" Interestingly, the Court called upon both domestic law (the Bulgarian Constitution) and international treaties to which Bulgaria was a signatory to make its decision (Helsinki Watch, 6-7, 1993; Ellis, 188, 1996).",1,1,0,other,legislative act,membership or affiliation with a certain group or organization,don't know,don't know,,court challenge ended the policy,1,1,0,0,,,0,0,2025-07-22

This law called for the opening of past Communist files. Officials then had one month to admit their past activities; if found to have worked for/associated with the past regime AND not willing to admit past activities, official would then have their files released to the public. If not, they would have it released and would be forced to resign their positions. As this is a law on declassification and dismissal, there is no known appeals process. It authorized the appointment of the Committee for Access to the Former State Security Files (Bonev Committee) to review the background of officials in position of power for evidence of communist of secret police employment or collaboration. The Committee was active from 1997-1999 and announced 27 individuals as collaborators. After the law was passed, the Socialist Party, the Alliance for National Salvation, and the Bulgarian Business Bloc filed a joint appeal to the Constitutional Court, arguing that it was unconstitutional on the grounds of creating a commission for investigating high-ranking officials, headed by the Minister of the Interior. The Constitutional Court largely upheld the law in its 22 September 1997 ruling. It limited the scope by forbidding the Commission from publicly releasing the names of tainted persons for whom the secret archive contained a name card, but no file. It further prevented the Commission from opening the files of the president, vice president, and members of the Constitutional Court on the basis that it would impair their ability to function.",0,0,1,legislature; executive; judiciary,legislative act,specific individual conduct; membership or affiliation with a certain group or organization,no,,,court challenge modified the policy,1,0,0,0,,,0,0,2025-07-22

This law acted to declassify files on people from various sectors scientists, public officials, politicians, clergymen/women, and journalists who acted as secret police agents during the past regime (Zimonjic, 2006). It provides for the publication of nearly all files that identify politicians, public officials, scientists, judges, church officials and journalists as secret police agents in the communist era. A nine-member declassification committee decides on the declassification and disclosure of files. ""This law gives the power to a special de classification committee to open such dossiers and decide which documents will be archived and remain classified. Files on employees of the intelligence service and the defense ministry will remain classified"" (Zimonjic, 2006). The law has enforceable employment consequences. In April 2007, the Committee for Disclosing the Documents and Announcing Affiliation of Bulgarian Citizens to the State Security and the Intelligence Services of the Bulgarian National Army (the Kostadinov Committee) was established to implement the new law. Between 2007-2017, the Committee reviewed more than 200,000 individuals, including prime and deputy ministers, MPs, employees in the presidential administration, mayors, and municipal councilor candidates for local elections, ministers, ambassadors, and “opinion-makers from among journalists and civil society representatives.

A wide range of public offices were subject to the Lustration Law, covering all elected or appointed positions in the state administration, the judiciary, the army and the media (Keesings, 1991, pg 38449). This included the Ministry of Defense, all ranks of the judiciary/prosecution office, the civil service, rank of head of department and higher and senior administrative positions in all constitutional bodies, the army and police force positions of colonel and higher, all intelligence service concerning political surveillance and persecutions, positions in the national bank, state media, press agencies, state corporations and universities (Priban, 2007, pg 311; Stan and Nedelsky, 2013 Volume II, pg 135). Those disqualified from the above positions were Communist Party Officials from the district level up, Communist Party Militia, secret police/intelligence services (Officers in the Corps of National Security), and secret police collaborators (Priban, 2007, pg 311). The law also screened for members of purge committees in 1948 and 1968, students at KGB schools, and owners of StB 'conspiration apartments'(Stan, 2009, pg 250). If the accused's case results in positive lustration, they can file an administrative complaint with the ministry. If the original ruling is unchanged, they can file a civil suit against the ministry demanding the protection of ""personal integrity"" (Priban, 2007, pg 314). There was a procedural guarantee; the persons accused may ""appeal to a competent body established in accordance with national practice"" (Kritz, 1995, pg 327 volume III) (Cited from Convention 4 of the Screening Law).

Soon after the military set up an interim government known as ""The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces"" (SCAF) to administer Egypt's affairs and intended transition to democracy. During their short rule from February 12, 2011, to June 29, 2012, SCAF introduced a number of informal vetting policies targeting individuals associated with Mubarak Era human rights abuses. This was aimed to separate the new administration from the stained legacy of the deposed dictator. These policies include: -Vetting of Top Security Officials for Their Role in the Decision to Open Fire on Pro-democracy Protestors - On February 15th, 2011, Egypt's interim government, the ""Supreme Council of Armed Forces"" dismissed Adly Fayed, the director of public security at Egypt's interior ministry, and Ismail El Shaer, Egypt's security chief. This was a response to their direct role in the decision to order security forces to open fire on pro-democracy protestors during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Approximately 846 people were killed and 6400 were injured due to the deliberate use of lethal force by security forces. -Vetting of Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq for Association to Hosni Mubarak -On March 3rd, 2011, Egypt's interim government, the ""Supreme Council of Armed Forces"", announced that they had ordered the resignation of Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq. Shafiq was a close ally to the ousted dictator Hosni Mubarak and a part of his former government. This comes following pressure from the Egyptian public and political activists who argue that the continued presence of government officials who were a part of Mubarak's regime undermines efforts to build a new democratic government. [Timo's note re. this and the next: not a vetting but change of government] -Vetting of Mubarak’s Cabinet Appointees from the New Government for Their Association with the Former Regime’s Rights Abuses -On March 6, 2011, in naming his new cabinet, newly appointed Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf replaced Mubarak's appointees from key cabinet posts following protests demanding their removal for their association with Mubarak-era rights abuses. This is an effort to fulfil the promise Sharaf made upon entering office to meet protestors' demands for justice and political reform. Those vetted included the minister of justice, Mamdouh Marie, minister of foreign affairs, Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, and interior minister, Mohmoud Wagdi*. *Note: On January 28th, 2011, Mohmoud Wagdi replaced Interior Minister Habib El-Adly who was vetted for his decision to order security forces to fire on protesters (see vettingID 192). However, being appointed by Mubarak himself, Wagdi was seen as an unfit replacement and many people called for his removal and replacement with someone unassociated with Mubarak. Note: Being a part of a broader general appointment of cabinet ministers, this vetting is very informal. However, I have chosen to include it because it is a direct response to protests demanding the removal of Mubarak-era officials from the new government for their association with the former regime's rights abuses. -Vetting of Police for Human Rights Abuses During the Rule of Hosni Mubarak -On July 13, 2011, under orders from Interior Minister Mansour El-Issawi, Egypt's interim government's security chief fired 669 police officers. This vetting primarily targeted the upper ranks of the police force: 505 of those vetted were major generals, 82 were brigadier generals, 82 were colonels and 10 were also top assistants to Mubarak-era interior minister Habib al-Adli. Those dismissed formally ended their service on August 1st, 2011. 37 of these dismissed police officers also faced charges for murdering protestors. This vetting was a response to human rights abuses committed by police during the former Hosni Mubarak regime. Such abuses include the torture of citizens and the killing of nearly 900 protestors during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.",1,0,0,police (includes ordinary police and secret police informants); executive,executive,specific individual conduct; membership or affiliation with a certain group or organization,no,no,"These policies have not been questioned.

Having occurred in response to anti-government protests, this policy seemed a concession made by Mubarak to appease protestors' demands that his government be dissolved. However, the policy targeted Interior Minister Habib el-Adly who was involved in grave human rights abuses. It was primarily el-Adly's decision to order security forces to use lethal force on pro-democracy protestors during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. As a result of his orders, 846 people were killed and 6400 were injured. While this policy was a concession, the result was the vetting of an individual involved in immense human rights violations. Additionally, El-Adly would have likely been properly vetted by Egypt's Supreme Council of Armed Forces, because of rights violations, had this not been done by Mubarak first. Prior to his dismissal, many protestors demanded specifically that El-Adly be removed from his position because of his ordering of the police to kill protestors. Further, shortly after Egypt's regime change in 2011, El-Adly was arrested and investigated for his role in the killing of protestors. Later, in 2012, El-Adly was convicted of murdering protestors alongside deposed dictator Hosni Mubarak and sentenced to life in prison. Additionally, top assistants to El-Adly and other members of the Mubarak-era interior ministry were vetted by the Supreme Council of Armed Forces following similar demands for their removal due to their involvement in, or association with, the killing of protestors (see vettingID 186, 189).",1,0,0,executive,executive,specific individual conduct,no,no,"Some observers point out that this vetting was an attempt by Mubarak to hold onto power.

The AHC began functioning on May 19, 1992 (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 94). Only high-ranking officers were vetted (with the exception of captains ""implicated"" during the investigation of others) (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 91) and considerations included, in part, respect for human rights (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 83). The AHC was supposed to operate for three months but its mandate was extended one month (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 94). It relied on reports prepared by an NGO (El Rescate) about officers' violations, as well as interviews with the officers themselves. Its final report (September 1992) was not made public but its findings became an ""open secret."" It recommended the transfer or dismissal of 103 officers as well as the minister and vice-minister of defense (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 95). There was not an appeals process as recommendations were ""non-negotiable"" (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 90). By the original deadline (December 1992), the government had dismissed or transferred most of the officers listed (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 94). By July 1993, the UN reported the government's ""broad compliance"" with AHC recommendations (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 95). This was a one-time process and is therefore not in force today. The January 1992 peace accords between the Salvadoran government and FMLN rebels provided for the dissolution of the FMLN (rebel guerilla group) and National Police (PN) and replaced the latter with a new National Civilian Police (PNC). Members of both FMLN and PN were eligible to join to PNC, the PNC could only be made up of 20% FMLN and 20% PN, and initial vetting of applicants was required (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 93). Group affiliation (PN, FMLN) put restrictions (in the form of a quota) on application to the PNC. PN applicants were then evaluated, in part, on their ‘conduct’ by the newly created National Public Security Academy and this evaluation was verified by ONUSAL (the UN mission in El Salvador) (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 88, 93). I find no evidence of an appeals process. ""Defective screening procedures"" resulted in imperfect implementation, but no particular aspect of the policy went unimplemented (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 98-99).

This treaty, among other things, called for the vetting of employees of the Former GDR (Wilke, 368, 2007). Paragraphs four and five of appendix I, chapter XIX, section III of the Unification Treaty call for the vetting and dismissal of public-sector employees based on one (or a combination) of three reasons. Paragraph four states that “ordinary” dismissals can occur within the public sector if there is a ""'lack of demand'"" for that employee or his or her position. Paragraph five calls for ""extraordinary"" dismissals (those without a notice in advance) for those who were active in the former Ministry for state Security or because the employee had ""'violated basic principles of humanity and the rule of law...guaranteed in the 1966 Convention on Civil and Political Rights….and…in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.'""These individuals aren't banned from future employment. Rather, future employment is dependent on an individual, case by case basis of said individuals, creating a public sector that is personally suitable and ""…(subscribes) to the principles of the (new) Constitution."" It must also be added that this vetting process occurred in various degrees. The universities, wanting to be seen as centers of academia and intelligence, widened their scope and their standards were stricter, while police (Wilke, 368-370 , 2007). The clause on ""lack of demand"" was set to expire in 1993, while the clause on ""extraordinary"" dismissal does not have a known set end date. It is unclear if there is an appeals process, but there has been at least one known case taken against a ruling based on this section Unification Treaty. In Knauth v. Germany, a former nursery-school teacher sued against her dismissal, which was caused by her admittance of past-involvement with the former State Security (Wilke, 368-370, 2007; Knauth, 2001).

Interestingly, this law, acting to respect the basic principles, is a ""duplicate"" law of an act originally passed in August 1990 by the then-active German Democratic Republic Parliament, acting to “validate” the 1990 law in the new, unified Germany. Like the law of 1990, this law acted to declassify Stasi files, but it was done in a unique manner. Instead of releasing all files, it called for the releasing of specific files depending on who is the requesting party: victims, past-Stasi informers, researchers, or public sector employers (Wilke, 372-373, 2007). Public sector employers—many being churches; political parties; parliaments and governments at local, state, and federal level; associations; public universities; and employers for lay judges, lawyers, and notary publics—could request files of those seeking employment. However, only files from 1975 onward would be considered for release to employers—unless files from before 1975 showed ""…crimes or violations of basic principles of humanity"" (Kritz, 621, 1993; Wilke, 373-374, 2007). Furthermore, those who took active involvement in the Stasi or committed crimes against humanity can be dismissed from their position (Pendas, 196, 2013). The law was created to expire in 2006. However, in December of that year, the Bundestag extended the laws validity to 2011. There has been a decline in requests for documents.

It is unknown if there is an appeals process. However, those being vetted do receive a notification when a request is made by an employer for their file, and in some cases, consent is needed (Wilke, 373, 2007).

Between the August and November 1974, the transitional government removed eleven military generals through the Supreme National Defense Council (an existing body authorized to promote and retire military officers), but there doesn't appear to have been an official decree associated with this action (Sotiropoulos 2007, 128). This vetting was part of wider ""dejuntafication"" efforts (Sotiropoulos 2007, 125). In addition to the eleven generals affected, an ""unverified number"" of lower-ranking officers were temporarily suspended (Sotiropoulos 2007, 128). Overall, vetting criteria included whether the officer held a high-ranking position immediately before the fall of the junta or whether the officer was involved in the coup that led to the takeover of the junta in the first place (Sotiropoulos 2007, 128). After an attempted coup by some officers in February 1975, the (elected) government forced 500 military officers into early retirement and transferred 600-800 to different posts (Sotiropoulos 2007, 137). It's unclear what vetting criteria were used for this widespread purge. In August 1974, the transitional government started replacing, reassigning and ""pensioning off"" police and security personnel who either held high-ranking positions under the junta or were known human rights violators. The prime ministers and other ministers of the transitional government made these decisions. A government was democratically elected in November 1974. Vetting continued at least through 1975. In mid-summer 1974, the transitional government dismissed the chiefs of the urban police and gendarmerie, the intelligence service and National Security Service because of these officers' association with the previous regime. Some lower-ranking officers in these bodies were reassigned to an inactive status because of their particularly bad human rights records. After an attempted coup in February 1974, a greater number of police officers were forced to retire (Sotiropoulos 2007, 138). An estimated 92 officers were purged in total (Sotiropoulos 2007, 139). Greece's judicial vetting policy is made up by four different pieces of legislation issued by the transitional government: (1) Constitutional Act of August 7, 1974 [called for the reinstatement of the Highest Disciplinary Council (HDC), a pre-junta institution], (2) Constitutional Act of September 5, 1974 [called for the reinstitution of judges who had been dismissed by the junta and for the vetting (by the HDC) of judges promoted by the junta to the posts of president and vice president in the country's three highest courts, and established vetting criteria and sanctions], (3) Constitutional Act of September 24, 1974 [modified the procedures of the September 5 Act, but only in that the task of restituting junta-purged judges was moved to the cabinet (had been the responsibility of the service councils of the judiciary)], (4) Legislative Decree of September 30, 1974 [further determined ""organizational aspects"" of the HDC including that there would be no right to appeal its decisions] (Sotiropoulos 2007, 130-132). The unelected transitional government issued three acts relevant to vetting of academics, which itself was part of a wider ""dejuntafication"" campaign (Sotiropoulos 2007, 125). The Constitutional Act of September 3, 1974 called for the rehiring of professors dismissed by the junta and for the establishment of the Special Disciplinary Council (SDC) to vet certain categories of academics and set criteria for academic vetting. According to the September 3 Act, professors could be vetted if they 1) were appointed by the junta to a public sector post between 1967 and 1974, 2) had sided with the junta inside the university system (e.g. by denouncing left-wing students or sitting on junta-staffed bodies), 3) had been appointed/elected to university posts previously held by junta-purged academics, or 4) were lower-level professors hired after 1967 (Sotiropoulos 2007, 134-35). Presidential Decree 652/1974 appointed the nine members of the SDC. Legislative Decree 88/1974 reversed certain provisions of the September 3 Act so that academics could only be vetted if they were shown to be active supporters of the junta, not simply if they were appointed by the junta.",1,1,0,"public sector employee (bureaucrats, low-rank nominated or elected officials); police (includes ordinary police and secret police informants); legislature; armed forces",executive,specific individual conduct; membership or affiliation with a certain group or organization,,,,don't know,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,2025-07-22

Between 1979 and 1980, roughly 7000 people were forcibly disappeared, kidnapped, or murdered as a national counterinsurgency campaign took place, with death squads operating freely with the support of the private sector. In 1982, at least 300 people were being assassinated each month, many of which were killed by rightist death squads which were made up of members from the Guatemalan police force. Gen. Lucas Garcia was ousted by a military junta composed of Gen. Jose Efrain Rios Montt (who later took over as president), Gen. Horacio Maldonado, and Gen. Francisco Guillermo Rodríguez. Following the new junta in power, they vowed to purge the national police force of officers who were accused of repression during the Lucas Gracia regime; some of these officers may have also been associated with paramilitary death squads. Officials who were purged were: Chief of detectives Pedro Arredondo and Carlos Enrique Suchite, the police chief of the eastern province of Zacapa, both of which were linked to paramilitary death squads operating in the country. Gen. Rene Quinteras, head of the armed forces garrison in Quetzaltenango province, Gen. Herman Chupina, former director of the National Police, Gen. Carlos Morales Villatoro, former commander of the Guatemalan Air Force, all three were sympathetic to the Lucas Garcia Regime and part of government positions which were associated with committing human rights violations. However, more than just these individuals were purged. At the start of the purge, police had detained at least 20 other government officials. Although there is no official number of individuals who were removed from their positions, there were at least 20+ cases where individuals were purged or investigated for human rights violations during the Lucas Garcia era, which were part of the government or held police/death squad positions.

Following President Arzu’s first week in office, he purged security forces from both the military and police force. Specifically, President Arzu purged 118 police officers, 80 of which were commanders, and forcibly retired 4 army generals with 3 being temporarily suspended. Guatemala has faced a severe civil war with extensive human rights violations plaguing the population. Those who were removed from their positions were linked to not only human rights violations, but drug-trafficking, theft, as well as kidnapping rings. For instance, Colonel Julio Roberto Alpirez was dismissed for the torture and murder of guerrilla leader Efrain Bamaca, whereas Colonel Mario Roberto Garcia Catalan was accused of complicity in slaying of American Michael DeVine in 1990. Many more severe human rights violations, such as forced disappearances, were accounted for during the purge of security forces. Overall, the conflict itself has claimed 150,000 lives, with many Guatemalans being forced to seek refuge in surrounding countries. Close to the end of the year in September, the government of Guatemala and rebel forces (Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, URNG) signed an agreement to end the war and progress towards a more progressive and democratic Guatemala.",1,0,0,police (includes ordinary police and secret police informants); armed forces,executive,specific individual conduct; membership or affiliation with a certain group or organization,don't know,no,"The fairness of the policy has not been questioned, it has been advocated for and well received by both the public and human rights advocates, such as Helen Mack.

118,,Haiti,41,1994,1995,Dismissals of military officers and vetting of interim police force,Licenciement d'officiers militaires et filtrage des forces de police intérimaires,,"In 1991, the democratically-elected government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overthrown in a military coup. The military government, led by Raoul Cedras, committed numerous human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings. In 1994, the United States military invaded Haiti and restored Aristide to power. In late 1994 and early 1995, Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide retired or removed more than 30 top army officers (a different source counts 66 dismissals). Many were accused of human rights violations during the military regime. However, many of the same individuals were part of the coup that ousted Aristide in 1991, raising the possibility that the dismissals were politically motivated. After a few rounds of dismissals, all of Haiti's military officers above the rank of major had been dismissed or replaced (Hamilton Spectator 1 Dec 1994; Human Rights Watch 1995). No information is available regarding appeals processes or challenges to the policy. Later in 1995, the Haitian armed forces were disbanded entirely, also by executive fiat. However, that policy appears to have been separate from the quasi-formal dismissals discussed here: at the time he announced these dismissals, Aristide claimed that he could not abolish the military In 1991, the democratically elected government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overthrown in a military coup. The military government, led by Raoul Cedras, committed numerous human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings. In 1994, the United States military invaded Haiti and restored Aristide to power. Shortly thereafter, vetting procedures were instituted in order to assess candidates for an interim police force tasked with maintaining order. Also, as entrants to the training academy that would produce a permanent police force were vetted. Various sources confirm that the vetting procedures were intended to remove human rights violators from service (e.g. Human Rights Watch 1995, 6-7). The vetting policy and interim police force were a joint project of the Haitian government and the United States, Canada, and other international actors. However, various sources report that the policy was nominally headed by Haitian officials. For example, Aristide named a member of his cabinet to ""oversee the vetting process"" and that the commission charged with screening individual soldiers was chosen jointly by ""senior officials of the U.S. and Haitian governments"" (Washington Post, 27 Dec 1994; Washington Post, 9 Oct 1994; Human Rights Watch 1995, 12). There was no formal law, decree, or declaration of the policy, so it is best described as a ""quasi-formal"" policy. The interim police force was made up of former Haitian army soldiers. Initial plans suggested that approximately half of the Haitian military would be included in the new force (at the time of Aristide's return, Haitian armed forces numbered approximately 7,000). Individuals who had committed human rights violations were banned from According joining the new force (Human Rights Watch 1995, 12-14). A commission of high-ranking military officials was mandated with conducting the vetting. Agents of the commission visited army companies and ""conducted inquiries regarding the reputations of individual soldiers,"" including inquiries with local Haitian civilians and with soldiers' commanding officers. However, these procedures were significantly flawed: the commission lacked a mechanism to further investigate alleged abuses, nor is there any evidence of an appeals process for implicated individuals. Those who did not pass the commission's initial ""investigation"" were simply excluded (Human Rights Watch 1995, 12-14). It is estimated that less than 1,000 individuals were excluded from the interim force. As a result of the commission's poor implementation, several observers were concerned that many soldiers implicated in human rights abuses remained in the interim force (Human Rights Watch 1995).",1,0,0,police (includes ordinary police and secret police informants); armed forces,executive,specific individual conduct; membership or affiliation with a certain group or organization,,,Fairness is not under dispute since President Aristide had the powers to remove top ranks of the Armed Forces.

The vetting procedure (carried out by lustration commissions, each composed of three judges) sought to establish whether vettees had engaged in certain activities during the previous regime. Section 1 of the 1994 law defines activities of concern: 1) serving as career officers, top-secret officers or network members of III/III, 2) being in a position in which they received information collected by III/III, 3) being a member of the fascist Arrow Cross Party, 4) serving as a detachment police during the revolution of 1956 (Barrett et al 2007, 269). None of these activities concerns direct responsibility for human rights violations. The law gives vettees found to have committed these acts the choice between resigning their governmental post or having information about their past published (Barrett et al 2007, 269). None of these laws provides for the ban or dismissal of public officials (only their OPTION to resign). ""The implicit expectation was that most affected individuals would resign"" (Barrett et al 2007, 269-270). Individuals had opportunities to appeal decisions before information was revealed to the public (Barrett et al 2007, 270). The 1994 law targeted a wide swath of government employees: members of Parliament and the Government; President and Vice President of the national bank; ambassadors; army commanders, president, vice president and editor of national radio, TV and news service; chiefs of police; presidents, deans, general directors, and department heads of state-owned universities and colleges; career judges; district attorneys; editors of daily newspapers and weekly magazines; directors of state-owned agencies; managers of state-owned banks, financial institutions, and insurance companies (Ellis 1996, 183-184). There was a petition to the Hungarian Constitutional Court that resulted in that Court declaring aspects of the 1994 law unconstitutional (Halmai and Scheppele 1997, 172), but I was unable to find a source identifying who brought the petition. The law was ruled to be too vague in its targeting and inadequate in its treatment of the secrecy and freedom of information about individuals (Fithen 2009, 19). In response, the 1996 law narrowed the scope of the policy. Judges and prosecutors were no longer targeted, and the scope of vetting of the public administration and media was narrowed (Barrett et al 2007, 278-80). The 1996 also dealt with ""informational self-determination"" issues by creating a Historical Office to house communist security service files and provide access to affected individuals (Fithen 2009, 19). The 2000 law again expanded the scope of those targeted by the policy for lustration. Those newly targeted by this version were mostly in the media (Barrett et al 2007, 272). This law also renewed targeting of judges and prosecutors (Barrett et al 2007, 279). As of 2004 (when the lustration process expired), almost 9,600 officials had been screened, 126 were singled out for greater scrutiny, 24 resigned, and 15 had their decisions published (Fithen 2009, 19-20). Hungary took an early but a narrow and limited approach to lustration, delimiting the scope of positions to be screened to the president and parliament. While Hungary started lustration early, it was also one of the earliest to formally close the lustration process, thereby truncating the process compared to others in the region.

On August 18 2003, the Iraqi Governing Council established the Higher National De-Baathification Commission (HNDC) to administer de-Baathification and expanded somewhat the scope of the policy: de-Baathification would now affect positions in state bureaucracy, politics, civil institutions, and the media, disqualifying those who had been party members from the level of Uda Ferqa or higher, senior-level civil servants, members of ""oppressive institutions,"" and those guilty of ""stealing national wealth, aggression, and other crimes"" (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 12). The HNDC also changed the appeals process, making the procedures less transparent (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 13). De-Baathification provisions were included in the 2005 Constitution, banning those targeted from positions in the Presidency Council, Prime Ministership, Parliament and their equivalents at the state level. Also in 2005, the HNDC began barring candidates from running for office and dismissing judges serving on the Iraqi High Tribunal (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 15). In 2006, the work of the HNDC began to focus more on reinstatement of banned persons (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 23).

The AJC got involved in the January 2010 elections, working to disqualify from candidacy former Baath Party members, former members of secret intelligence and security institutions, and those who had ""promoted"" the Baath Party (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 19-20).",1,1,0,,executive,membership or affiliation with a certain group or organization,yes,yes,,court challenge modified the policy,0,0,1,0,,,0,0,2025-07-22

Administration Direction No. 2008/2 calls for those being appointed to meet, among other basic criteria, section six of Regulation No. 2005/52 , which calls for, among other things, applicants to be ""...of high moral integrity and not have been engaged in discriminatory practices as defined by law and judicial rules and procedures..."" (Administrative Direction 2008/2, 2008, 5; Regulation 2005/52, 2005, 6-7). This policy, calling for an invitation for applicants by a public announcement, opens the possibility of a wide spectrum of positions to apply for consideration (Administrative Direction 2008/2, 2008, 3). Section 6 of this direction outlines an appeals process. Those who fail to meet eligibility requirements for various reasons or are not selected can, within 15 days from notification by the IJPC, apply for reconsideration, based on one or more reasons: the decision was based ""on material errors or omissions,"" there is new important information not previously known/available at the time of decision, or there was a serious procedural error or omission in following the guidelines by this Administrative Direction (Administrative Decision 2008/2, 2008, 7-8). Of the 394 positions filled, sixty percent of people assigned to the before-mentioned positions are new to their position. Nevertheless, because of its young age it is unknown if this Administrative Decision has had any challenges or if any aspects have been outlawed, overruled, or cancelled for any reason. Thus, we cannot define the level of its implementation at this time. However, it's important to that the end of the IJPC mandate coincided with the formal transfer of judicial vetting functions to the Kosovo Judicial Council, which is now responsible for identification, screening and appointment of judges and prosecutors, to ensure their performance, integrity and discipline (Kosovo Legal Professional Program).",0,1,0,judiciary,treaty / intl mission,specific individual conduct,don't know,don't know,,don't know,0,0,1,0,,,0,0,2025-07-22

In 1992, the policy was expanded to cover all currently serving elected officials at the local and national level (Kritz 1995, 767-769). The law created a parliamentary committee charged with reviewing KGB records to identify deputies who were serving in the current government. These individuals were notified of their lustrated status and allowed to admit their collaboration or to appeal the committee's decision. Appeals of MPs went directly to the Lithuanian Supreme Court, while those of lower officials were handled by the courts of appeals. Those persons who admitted to past secret police association (or whose appeals were overruled) were subjected to a recall election. The ballot informed voters that the person was a known collaborator and asked whether or not his or her mandate should be renewed. In addition, the individual could resign at any point in the process. Thus, the only official sanction was declassification; however, it was expected that former collaborators would be forced out of government. A lustration committee was established and individuals were screened. Several high-profile cases, including the founder of one of the post-transition leftist parties, were lustrated (Kritz 1995, 767-769).

The revised 1999 lustration law—the Law on Registering and Confession (VIII-1436/1999) was passed in November 1999 and required former KGB collaborators to formally disclose collaboration within six months of the law’s publication (by June 8, 2000) to a five-member Lustration Commission (Republic of Lithuania 1999). The law explicitly granted the “right of the State to apply the principle of loyalty and trustworthiness to State officers and employees of State government and administration, local government…” as well as a host of related state and civil services (Article 1 §1 of Law VIII-1436/1999). The related semi-public and private sector positions included educational institutions, banks, “strategic businesses” (in communications), and private intelligence and security companies.

Its decisions can be challenged in court .In some cases, the Commission obtained a case number that demonstrated collaboration with the KGB, but the courts deemed such evidence inconclusive. As a result, the Commission has publicized the names of few individuals. Horne (2017) argues that: regarding phase two, the Lustration Commission had tepid political support, lacked resources, and the staff was voluntary and unpaid (Anušauskas 2011). File access issues, data reliability problems, and high information hurdles to legally prove collaboration posed substantial burdens on the resource strapped Commission (Vėgelytė 2009).

The Somoza regime was known for decades of human rights abuses and war crimes including suppression of free speech, censorship, extrajudicial killings, torture of political prisoners, disappearances, sexual violence, forced displacements, targeting of medical and humanitarian efforts and indiscriminate violence, such as massacres and bombings. Abuses against Rebels and civilians were heightened during the intrastate conflict with the FSLN. The new Sandinista government promised various reforms aimed at ending the pattern of oppression and brutality that the Somoza regime had perpetrated. This included the purging of the entire Somoza-era National Guard in July 1979 because of its direct responsibility in carrying out Somoza-era human rights abuses. The Somoza-era National Guard performed both military and police functions in Nicaragua and committed the previously mentioned rights abuses in both domains. The National Guard was replaced with a non-partisan national army, the ""Sandinista's People's Army"", and a police force, the ""Sandinista Police"". In addition to a broad purge of the entire Somoza-era National Guard, many dismissed officials suspected of having personal responsibility for abuses were arrested and faced trial. They were given jail time if found guilty and there are some records of executions. Note: trials did not occur to determine whether or not to dismiss individuals. All members of the National Guard were dismissed whether personally responsible for war crimes or not. Arrests and trials occurred after the all-encompassing purge as a form of additional punishment for purged individuals found personally responsible for rights abuses.

However, the Sandinista government also committed human rights abuses itself. Specifically, during the Sandinista's eleven years in power, the ""Sandinista's People's Army"", and the ""Sandinista Police"" (known as The National Police after 1990) were involved in the killing of perceived Contra supporters, disappearances, kidnappings, illegal detentions, and mistreatment and torture of prisoners. The Sandinistas peacefully turned power over to President Chamorro after being defeated in the 1990 democratic election. To address rights abuses committed by the Sandinista Police, in 1991, Chamorro established the ""Civil Inspection Unit"" within Nicuragua's Ministry of Government.

The ban affected former politicians as well as current and former military members who have held office (including Babangida himself) since Nigeria's 1960 independence from Britain. ""A wide range of senior office-holders during Nigeria's two periods of civilian rule, as well as military and police personnel in the current Administration"" were banned for five years, enough time to be excluded from all elections planned as part of the return to civilian rule. A lifetime ban from public office was received by ""anyone who was found guilty of corruption or other misdeeds"" since 1960 (Globe and Mail 25 Sep 1987; The Guardian 26 Sep 1987). While in force, the ban was effective in preventing former politicians and military leaders from seeking office.

My sources offer a few different reasons for the purge, including the abuses carried out by the military (Rupert 1999, A12) and Obasanjo's desire to consolidate his power, subordinate the military to civilian government, reduce corruption, and support democracy (""Nigeria"" 1999, 42984; Gordon 2003, 257). Hundreds of military officers were retired if they previously held positions as ""ministers, state governors, heads of government agencies and state-owned companies"" (Rupert 1999, A12) or if they were ""members of the former provisional ruling council during the Abacha regime"" (Gordon 2003, 257). This appears to be a one-time policy, but Obasanjo did also conduct a smaller purge a few years later (April 2002) when he replaced the chiefs of the army, navy, and air force (Gordon, 2003 257).

The law conforms to recommendations that Macedonia address ""the heritage of [the] former communist totalitarian system"" that was responsible for many abuses (Council of Europe 2013, 28). Under the terms of the original law, names of individuals who had been employed by or cooperated with former intelligence services were to be published in the Macedonian Official Gazette. The President of Macedonia, members of parliament and their staff, and judges were required to undergo lustration investigations (Bohnet and Bojadzieva 2011, 68). The law also included numerous non-governmental professions, including journalists, clergy, and NGO activists, although these provisions were eventually struck down by the Constitutional Court (Council of Europe 2013, 28). The lustration commission has investigated several hundred individuals. However, it has faced shortages of funding and staff, and concerns about its effectiveness were raised when an initial round of lustration found no collaborators among the ruling party (Bohnet and Bojadzieva 2011, 68). As of 2013, over 30 people had been declared former collaborators. Although several successfully appealed the Commission’s decision, concerns remain about due process (Council of Europe 2013, 29). The Constitutional Court has, on multiple occasions, limited the scope of the law. It ruled that lustration could not be applied to many non-governmental professions; it limited the historical period in question to the Communist era (1945-1991); and it ruled against the automatic publishing of names, due to concerns about privacy rights (Council of Europe 2013, 28-29; Marusic 2012; Bohnet and Bojadzieva 2011, 67). These decisions have resulted in a much weaker law. Most importantly, the lustration Commission no longer has a mandate for sanctions. It is noted that ""the appropriate court can ban [lustrated individuals] from taking public office,"" but further evidence confirming a ban as part of the official policy was not present (Bohnet and Bojadzieva 2011, 67-68). In response, in 2012 the majority party in the Macedonian parliament submitted and approved a new lustration law very similar to the 2008 version. Its approval by the Macedonian President was met with controversy, and it faces renewed Constitutional Court challenges. As of the time of writing, the legal status of lustration in Macedonia is uncertain (Marusic 2012; Council of Europe 2013, 29-30).

This law was imposed on a variety of positions, including President of the Republic, MPs, senators, judges, procurators, advocates, and people holding key positions in Polish Public Television, Polish Public Radio, the Polish Press Agency, and the Polish Information Agency (Czarnota, 2007, pg 232). The law consists of two sections: Part A asks for a declaration of complicity with the secret services. Part B asks for details of this collaboration in the event of a positive statement. These names become public, but without their associated acts of collaboration. Those who admit to collaboration can still hold office. The law does not punish collaboration itself, but only a lie concerning collaboration (Czarnota, 2007, pg 232-3). ""The Statutory requirement for holding public office is moral qualification to do so"" (Czarnota, 237). If an untrue lustration declaration is declared, individuals currently in office automatically lose their position, lose moral qualification to hold public office and are banned from holding one for ten years (Czarnota, 2007, pg 237). Within fourteen days of the judgment, parties can appeal the decision of the Lustration Court by three professional judges. After this decision, parties have a right to cassation by the Supreme Court within three months (Czarnota, 2007, pg 236-7).

Many leading intellectuals and left-wing politicians defied the law. According to Polish media reports, government ministers applied huge pressure on the independent constitutional court (Scally, the Irish Times, 2007).

Without any true legal sanctions, this law acted as declassification for those exposed as collaborators. The Law is dubbed Ticu Law, after its initiator – former political detainee, Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu. The Law was launched with the purpose of sole disclosure of agents and collaborators of 'Securitate (secret police) as a political police'. In 2006 a Government Ordinance for the Modification and Completion of Law No 187/1999 on the Access to the Personal File and the Disclosure of the Securitate, as a Political Police (No 16 of 12 February 2006) was issued. The 1999 Disclosure Law became Law on the Access to Personal Files and the Disclosure of the Communist Political Police.

The ERC claimed that these people obtained these jobs unlawfully through their connections with the Al Bashir regime. On September 12, 2021, the ERC removed 79 employees of Sudan's state-run ""Sudan News Agency"". During the Al Bashir regime, the agency was under strict control, serving as a propaganda tool. The individuals vetted were viewed to have supported the regime's control. On September 25, 2021, the ERC announced that it was removing 399 public employees from their positions. This included 86 employees of the Ministry of Roads and Bridges, 64 employees of the Land Authority, 30 employees from the Khartoum State Sanitation Authority, 17 judges (7 of which belonged to the Supreme Court or a court of appeal), 192 employees of the judiciary, and 10 prosecutors. Those vetted were associated with the Al Bashir regime. Push back: On October 25, 2021, under Army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the Sudanese military, which consisted of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), took control of the government from the Transitional Military Council through a coup. Immediately after the coup, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan ordered that the work of the ERC be paused and instructed Islamist Judge Mohamed Babiker, also known as Abu Sabiha, to reconsider its decisions. This led to the reversal of many ERC decisions. This included both its vetting decisions (especially pertaining to vetting of the judiciary) and its decisions regarding the recovery of public funds. These actions were a response to the new governments’ criticisms of the ERC. They argued that the committee did not abide by the procedures outlined in the ERC foundational “Dismantling Law” when making its decisions. The government, as well as other observers, also criticized the ERC for overreach, suggesting that it went too far with its vetting and economic recovery decisions. Throughout 2022, the new government would go on to arrest a number of the ERC’s members, including its chair, lawyer Wajdi Saleh, for charges including breach of trust, unjust enrichment, illegal foreign exchange trading, and the violation of accounting principles. Some of these members were eventually released. On January 13, 2025, the al-Burhan government designated 24 former members of the ERC as fugitives and ordered them to turn themselves in to the authorities within one week. The prosecutor’s office said this is a response to their violations of Sudan’s penal code, the ERC’s foundational Dismantling Law, and charges of breach of trust, criminal possession, and corruption.",1,0,0,"public sector employee (bureaucrats, low-rank nominated or elected officials); paramilitary groups (includes death squads and pro-government militias); legislature; executive; judiciary",constitutional act,specific individual conduct; membership or affiliation with a certain group or organization,no,yes,"The committee was questioned by observers for supposedly not abiding by the procedures outlined in the ERC's foundational “Dismantling Law” when making its decisions.

198,,Tunisia,616,2013,2013,The Law on The Political Immunisation of the Revolution,La loi sur l'immunisation politique de la révolution,,"On June 28th, 2013, the law on the ""l'Immunisation Politique de la Revolution"" (Political Immunisation of the Revolution), also known as the ""Political Exclusion Law"", was passed by the Republic of Tunisia. This law prohibits those with links to the old regime from presenting their candidacy in local and national elections, taking part in any political party and assuming certain administrative positions for a period of seven years. This law targets individuals who, between the 7th of November, 1987, and the 14th of January, 2011, were members of the Ben Ali government, occupied positions of responsibility within Ben Ali's Democratic Constitutional Rally (RCD) party and its subunits (including youth groups), or argued for allowing Ben Ali to participate in the presidential elections planned for 2014. The law also gives the responsibility to the Higher Independent Authority for Elections (ISIE) to determine a list of individuals that these criteria apply to. To make this list, the law mandates that the ISIE rely on 3 pieces of information. This includes the 2011 list used to exclude people from candidacy in the elections to the National Constituent Assembly (ANC) (see vettingID 101), information provided by the administration, and requests made by individuals to add others to the list, provided that these requests are backed up by evidence. Individuals named by the list are given an opportunity to appeal this decision via an administrative tribunal. Should the tribunal rule in favour of the appellant, the tribunal can then advise the ISIE to remove the name from its list. However, in practice, the tribunal's role is only to check whether the person on the list fits one of the three categories previously mentioned. People are not given the opportunity to introduce material and make a case that neither their past nor present activities could be a threat to democracy in Tunisia. Note: On August 25, 2013, the law on the Political Immunisation of the Revolution was suspended by Rashid Ghannouchi, leader of the Ennahda party (which is the party that introduced the law). The law was still suspended as of the time Preysing was writing in 2015.

The law established the ""Truth and Dignity Commission"" which had authority over various transitional justice policies in Tunisia including the truth commission, reparations, prosecutions, and vetting. In specific regard to vetting, the law requires the Truth and Dignity Commission to establish the ""Committee for Vetting Public Servants and Institutional Reform"". The committee is to issue a list for the banning or dismissal or obligatory retirement ""of any individual that occupies one of the senior posts of the state, including judiciary posts"" if there is evidence that he/she: ""a) Submitted reports or information to the dissolved Constitutional Democratic Rally, or the political police, which led to harm or violation as prescribed hereof. b) Performed an intentional act that resulted in support or assistance to persons subject to the provisions of Decree Number 13 of 2013 in looting public money. c) Proven to be responsible of committing violations as prescribed hereof.""

Among the core demands of the revolution were to cleanse the government from corruption, nepotism, and various undemocratic practices, and the law aimed at delivering on those goals. To achieve those goals, the law aimed to lustrate people who held public service positions during the Yanukovych years and met substantive and temporal criteria established by the law, for example, the criteria of participating in unlawful and undemocratic practices during the Euromaidan protests or holding certain positions for at least one year during Yanukovych's reign. In addition, the law also targeted individuals who were affiliated with the Soviet Communist Party, Soviet security and intelligence services, individuals who violated assets declaration requirements under the Ukrainian anti-corruption legislation, and those who, by their actions, endangered Ukraine’s national security and territorial integrity, including via cooperation with foreign security services.",1,1,0,"public sector employee (bureaucrats, low-rank nominated or elected officials); police (includes ordinary police and secret police informants); executive; judiciary; armed forces",legislative act,specific individual conduct; membership or affiliation with a certain group or organization,yes,yes,"The European Commission for Democracy through Law (the “Venice Commission”), an expert advisory body of the Council of Europe on constitutional law matters, issued two opinions on the Lustration Law in 2014 and 2015, containing suggestions to improve and make the Lustration Law fully compliant with European standards. A number of prominent scholars, lawyers, and NGOs took the position that a law is not fair and constitutional, among other things, considering that it targeted a broad group of people without sufficient and immediate nexus to undemocratic practices. In Polyakh and others v. Ukraine (applications nos. 58812/15 and others, Judgment of 17 October 2019), the European Court of Human Rights found that the lustration of several individuals under the law violated those individuals' rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. Namely, the Court found that Ukraine violated the applicants' right to a fair trial within a reasonable time. This was so as the court proceedings based on their complaints lasted for more than four and a half years since the district court waited for the Constitutional Court to decide on whether the lustration measures were constitutional. In turn, the Constitutional Court’s proceedings were unjustifiably delayed. The Court also ruled on the violation of the applicants' right to privacy, considering that the nature and broad scope of lustration measures were disproportionate to the legitimate aim of preserving democracy. The Court mentioned the following factors in this regard: i. The application of the lustration law did not involve any individual assessment of the lustrated persons’ conduct, including their alleged commission of any specific acts to the detriment of democracy, the rule of law, national security, or human rights. ii. The state needed compelling reasons to use such a broad lustration scheme and to explain how merely being a public servant during the Yanukovych government for a certain time could signify a lack of loyalty to democratic principles. iii. The scheme was overbroad and not sufficiently narrowed down to the “pressing social need.” For example, several applicants were lustrated merely because they failed to resign from their posts one year after Yanukovych became the president. In this case, the triggering event of somebody taking office instead of some negative developments connected to individuals was not a justified criterion for dismissing career public servants. iv. The Court noted that the then-President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, who signed the lustration law himself was a minister in the Yanukovych government for less than a year. In the Court’s opinion, that makes it hard to see how the goal of the lustration law could be achieved by removing far less important officials from public services. On a separate note, the Court had doubts about whether the law pursued the declared legitimate aims rather than the desire for retribution. Following the decision of the Court, the Ukrainian Supreme Court issued a decision in favor of a lustrated person (ordering the reinstatement of the person to the previously held position) based on the violation of the Convention with reasoning similar to that of the Court and despite the parallel constitutional review by the Constitutional Court. This decision ignited the spark of other cases ordering the reinstatement of lustrated individuals to their position in the state apparatus.",court challenge did not modify the policy,1,0,1,0,,,0,0,2025-07-22

For this, a Temporary Special Commission under the auspices of the High Council of Justice was established to run the special screening and issue conclusions on whether the actions of a particular judge constitute violations of their oath, disciplinary or criminal offenses. If the violations are found, the conclusion is sent to a responsible body to decide on the judge’s potential dismissal (the High Council of Justice for a violation of the oath; the High Council of Justice or the High Qualification Commission of Judges for a disciplinary offense; and the Prosecutor General Office for criminal offenses). The judges can challenge their dismissal in court. The process is individualized and concerns each judge's potentially unlawful individual conduct. In addition to the special screening, “final and transitional” provisions of the Lustration of Judges Law encompassed the blanket dismissal of all court chairs, ensuring fair electability of such positions by the judges of each court by secret ballot (many of those chairs were reelected) and the premature dismissal of the High Council of Justice and the High Qualification Commission of Judges members.

This was done in partnership with the Central Committee of Mugabe's own party, the Zanu-PF, who grew to resent the president for his leadership style. Mugabe's political life was initially viewed as positive as he championed against racial injustice. However, when he became president, he ruled as a tyrant and stained Zimbabwe's human rights record, mainly in his repression of the political opposition and its supporters. For example, throughout the 1980s, about 20,000 people suspected to have been supporters of Mugabe's political opposition were killed in a series of military crackdowns. Similarly, each general election occurring in his nearly 40-year-long rule was followed by an increase in human rights abuses as supporters of the opposition faced torture, harassment, intimidation, and death. There were also many disappearances. Robert Mugabe's wife, Grace Mugabe, age 52, rose to high ranks within the Zanu-PF party as leader of the Zanu-PF Generation 40 (G40) faction and was next in line for president. On November 19, 2017, following the ousting of President Mugabe by the military, the Central Committee of the Zanu-PF formally vetted numerous people loyal to Mugabe, banning them from office.
