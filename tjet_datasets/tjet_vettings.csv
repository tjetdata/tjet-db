The revised 1999 lustration law—the Law on Registering and Confession (VIII-1436/1999) was passed in November 1999 and required former KGB collaborators to formally disclose collaboration within six months of the law’s publication (by June 8, 2000) to a five-member Lustration Commission (Republic of Lithuania 1999). The law explicitly granted the “right of the State to apply the principle of loyalty and trustworthiness to State officers and employees of State government and administration, local government…” as well as a host of related state and civil services (Article 1 §1 of Law VIII-1436/1999). The related semi-public and private sector positions included educational institutions, banks, “strategic businesses” (in communications), and private intelligence and security companies. The law also clarified the creation and functions of a Lustration Commission to facilitate the review of the lustration applications for evidence of collaboration (Pettai and Pettai 2014, 155).

In the early 1990s, 800 individuals had “confessed” to a temporary commission to past collaboration; some of them “confessed” again in 2000. An estimated 25,000 people in independent Lithuania had collaborated with the KGB; one-tenth of them “confessed.” Employment restrictions were placed on eighty-seven people who worked for or collaborated with the KGB out of approximately 300 cases (RFE/RL 1999, November 18; RFE/RL 2000, August 8; RFE/RL 2000, August 16). In general, the number of compulsory employment changes was relatively small. During the second phase, compulsory disclosure and possible employment removal resulted for individuals who did not self-lustrate during phase one. In phase two, the work of the Lustration Commission was hampered by budget, staffing and political issues - very few cases were brought. In 2010 ,an amendment to Law VIII-1436 eliminated restrictions on former KGB agents working in the private sector. (Dovile and Budryte, p 8; Horne, 2017).

The Lustration Commission, mandated to identify and publicly release the names of former KGB operatives who refused to voluntarily confess their past, has struggled with an unpaid staff and lack of political support from leftist governments. Its decisions can be challenged in court .In some cases, the Commission obtained a case number that demonstrated collaboration with the KGB, but the courts deemed such evidence inconclusive. As a result, the Commission has publicized the names of few individuals. Horne (2017) argues that: regarding phase two, the Lustration Commission had tepid political support, lacked resources, and the staff was voluntary and unpaid (Anušauskas 2011). File access issues, data reliability problems, and high information hurdles to legally prove collaboration posed substantial burdens on the resource strapped Commission (Vėgelytė 2009).

85,369,0,,Law about the Cleansing of Government [No. 1682-VII ―On Government Cleansing / “On Purification of Power”],2014-09-16,"Following the Euromaidan Revolution and the ensuing escape of notorious former Ukrainian President Yanukovych to Russia, Ukraine adopted the law to cleanse the central and local government of people who contributed to (1) power usurpation by Yanukovych, (2) undermining the foundations of Ukraine's national security and defense, and (3) violations of human rights and freedoms, including during the Euromaidan protests. Among the core demands of the revolution were to cleanse the government from corruption, nepotism, and various undemocratic practices, and the law aimed at delivering on those goals. To achieve those goals, the law aimed to lustrate people who held public service positions during the Yanukovych years and met substantive and temporal criteria established by the law, for example, the criteria of participating in unlawful and undemocratic practices during the Euromaidan protests or holding certain positions for at least one year during Yanukovych's reign. In addition, the law also targeted individuals who were affiliated with the Soviet Communist Party, Soviet security and intelligence services, individuals who violated assets declaration requirements under the Ukrainian anti-corruption legislation, and those who, by their actions, endangered Ukraine’s national security and territorial integrity, including via cooperation with foreign security services.",2014,,Legislature/Parliament,legislative act,Yes (fully or partially),"The performance of lustration measures takes place in two scenarios: (1) screening individuals who apply for positions in public service and (2) checking individuals who already occupy positions in public service. Under the first scenario, a person applying for a relevant public service position (but for the military personnel conscripted during the martial law) must submit a statement affirming that the lustration criteria apply or do not apply to them and agree to be subject to special screening procedure (background checks) and the publication of relevant information about it. If the screening establishes that the individual is subject to lustration measures, this constitutes a ground for refusing the individual’s application for the sought position. As to acting public officials, the process is more complicated and contains many aspects. The whole body of public officials is screened according to the law in the process coordinated by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine but executed firsthand by responsible supervisors of respective state and municipal bodies where public officials work. In essence, the lustration process is decentralized, allowing state bodies to conduct lustration within and by themselves. The Ministry of Justice has access to details and information on how the process in each body is taking place and can recommend certain steps and publicly and privately highlight deficiencies of the process, but it lacks binding enforcement powers of its own under the Lustration Law. As required by the Lustration Law, the Ministry of Justice created the public council on lustration consisting of civil society’s representatives to exert public control over the lustration process, but it does not have any binding instruments to influence the process. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (government) confirms the schedule of screening procedures in different bodies proposed by the Ministry of Justice. Pursuant to this schedule, supervisors of relevant public officials in state and municipal bodies (who are authorized to discharge screened public officials) are responsible for conducting the screening, including sending requests for receiving relevant information from responsible public bodies. The supervisors perform the screening procedure based on the statements submitted by public officials, as described below. Namely, the persons occupying public positions must submit a statement to the responsible supervisors within ten days from the start of screening procedures at the relevant state or municipal body according to the schedule established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (government). The statement must state whether the lustration criteria apply to the individual at hand and contain an agreement to be subject to special screening procedures (background checks) and to publish relevant information about the individual according to the Lustration Law. The statement in which an individual confirms that it is subject to lustration is a ground for this individual discharge from the occupied position and the application of the respective ban for occupying public positions in the future. As mentioned earlier, if the person does not submit the statement within the prescribed deadline, that is an independent ground for their discharge and the 10-year lustration ban, even if the person would not be subject to lustration otherwise. Every submitted statement goes via the background check process. If allegedly erroneous information is identified in those statements by controlling bodies, the screened person has a procedural opportunity to provide explanations and evidence in support of the information provided in the statement. The negative report based upon the background checks is a ground for discharge of the person and entering it into the public register of lustrated individuals. The screened individuals can challenge the substance of background check reports and their discharge from public service in court. Albeit the main text of the Lustration Law provides the screening procedure for acting officials based on the statements submitted by those officials within the scheduled screening mentioned earlier, the section of “final and transitional provisions” of the Lustration Law obliges the supervisors in state and municipal bodies to conduct the lustration measures based on personal files outside the scheduled process mentioned above but instead within ten days after the Lustration Law becomes effective. The information about the persons discharged from public service based on the Lustration Law is entered into the public register (administered by the Ministry of Justice) and becomes publicly available. As of 2020, the register of lustrated individuals reportedly contained around 900 former public officials discharged pursuant to the Lustration Law (the register is currently not accessible). However, in practice, individuals subject to lustration who quit public service voluntarily were not entered into the registry , and their numbers can be significant. The registry contains only individuals who did not quit independently and, in many cases, wanted to challenge their discharge in courts later on. The Ukrainian media reported that around 4 thousand former officials of the Yanukovych era felt indirect consequences of the law via the prohibition of being appointed to public positions. That said, there is no official public information on the total number of individuals directly and indirectly affected by the Lustration Law. Complaints of lustrated individuals and other stakeholders in courts Many individuals discharged under the Lustration Law filed complaints to Ukrainian courts of the administrative jurisdiction. Considering that cases on the Lustration Law touched novel and controversial constitutional issues, courts suspended their proceedings pending the constitutional review of the Lustration Law in the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. In 2014-2015, the Supreme Court of Ukraine and 47 members of the parliament from the opposition filed their separate petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Lustration Law to the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. The Constitutional Court conducted open hearings in 2016 but has yet to issue a decision to this date. Many lustrated officials submitted their complaints to the European Court of Human Rights (“Court”) on the violation of their human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (“Convention”). In 2019, the Court issued its first decision in favor of five individuals lustrated under the Lustration Law finding the violation of their right to fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention (due to the prolonged suspension of the lustration cases pending the Constitutional Court’s review of the Lustration Law) and right to privacy under Article 8 of the Convention. Following the decision of the Court, the Ukrainian Supreme Court issued a decision in favor of a lustrated person (ordering the reinstatement of the person to the previously held position) based on the violation of the Convention with reasoning similar to that of the Court and despite the parallel constitutional review by the Constitutional Court. This decision ignited the spark of other cases ordering the reinstatement of lustrated individuals to their position in the state apparatus.",court challenge did not modify the policy,"~700,000 intended; > 86,730 by Oct 2016","The Law about the Cleansing of the Government, 2014 Tooshi, M.

A number of prominent scholars, lawyers, and NGOs took the position that a law is not fair and constitutional, among other things, considering that it targeted a broad group of people without sufficient and immediate nexus to undemocratic practices. In Polyakh and others v. Ukraine (applications nos. 58812/15 and others, Judgment of 17 October 2019), the European Court of Human Rights found that the lustration of several individuals under the law violated those individuals' rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. Namely, the Court found that Ukraine violated the applicants' right to a fair trial within a reasonable time. This was so as the court proceedings based on their complaints lasted for more than four and a half years since the district court waited for the Constitutional Court to decide on whether the lustration measures were constitutional. In turn, the Constitutional Court’s proceedings were unjustifiably delayed. The Court also ruled on the violation of the applicants' right to privacy, considering that the nature and broad scope of lustration measures were disproportionate to the legitimate aim of preserving democracy. The Court mentioned the following factors in this regard: i. The application of the lustration law did not involve any individual assessment of the lustrated persons’ conduct, including their alleged commission of any specific acts to the detriment of democracy, the rule of law, national security, or human rights. ii. The state needed compelling reasons to use such a broad lustration scheme and to explain how merely being a public servant during the Yanukovych government for a certain time could signify a lack of loyalty to democratic principles. iii. The scheme was overbroad and not sufficiently narrowed down to the “pressing social need.” For example, several applicants were lustrated merely because they failed to resign from their posts one year after Yanukovych became the president. In this case, the triggering event of somebody taking office instead of some negative developments connected to individuals was not a justified criterion for dismissing career public servants. iv. The Court noted that the then-President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, who signed the lustration law himself was a minister in the Yanukovych government for less than a year. In the Court’s opinion, that makes it hard to see how the goal of the lustration law could be achieved by removing far less important officials from public services. On a separate note, the Court had doubts about whether the law pursued the declared legitimate aims rather than the desire for retribution. Following the decision of the Court, the Ukrainian Supreme Court issued a decision in favor of a lustrated person (ordering the reinstatement of the person to the previously held position) based on the violation of the Convention with reasoning similar to that of the Court and despite the parallel constitutional review by the Constitutional Court.

16,355,0,,Law on Access to the State Security Documents (Law on Secret Police Files),1997-07-30,"On 7 July 1997, the parliament of Bulgaria adopted the Law on Disclosure of Secret Police Files through legislation (Indzhev, 1997; Ellis, 189, 1996). This law called for the opening of past Communist files. Officials then had one month to admit their past activities; if found to have worked for/associated with the past regime AND not willing to admit past activities, official would then have their files released to the public. If not, they would have it released and would be forced to resign their positions. As this is a law on declassification and dismissal, there is no known appeals process. It authorized the appointment of the Committee for Access to the Former State Security Files (Bonev Committee) to review the background of officials in position of power for evidence of communist of secret police employment or collaboration. The Committee was active from 1997-1999 and announced 27 individuals as collaborators. After the law was passed, the Socialist Party, the Alliance for National Salvation, and the Bulgarian Business Bloc filed a joint appeal to the Constitutional Court, arguing that it was unconstitutional on the grounds of creating a commission for investigating high-ranking officials, headed by the Minister of the Interior. The Constitutional Court largely upheld the law in its 22 September 1997 ruling. It limited the scope by forbidding the Commission from publicly releasing the names of tainted persons for whom the secret archive contained a name card, but no file. It further prevented the Commission from opening the files of the president, vice president, and members of the Constitutional Court on the basis that it would impair their ability to function.",1997,2002,Legislature/Parliament,legislative act,Yes (fully or partially),"The law was limited by a 22 September 1997 Constitutional Court ruling, which forbade it to publicly release the names of tainted persons for whom the secret archive contained a name card, but no file.",court challenge modified the policy,150,"""Bulgaria's Politics: A wrangle over revealing communist-era secrets.""

65,235,0,,Purge of civil servants: Decree Law 277 (25 June 1974),,"After the 1974 transition in Portugal, the provisional government issued a series of decree laws to regulate purges of the civil service occurring without regulation ('wildcat' purges). Decree Law 277 (25 June 1974) established a vetting commission (Inter-ministerial Purge and Reclassification Commission or CIMSR) to coordinate existing purge commissions and create new ones for ministries without them. This law also established criteria for vetting civil servants. This legislation was ""revised several times"" between 1974 and 1976. Decree Law 123 (11 March 1975) introduced new criteria for vetting civil servants (Pinto 2006, pages 181, 183). According to Decree Law 277, criteria for sanction included ""non-democratic behavior in the course of duty after the coup, inability to adapt to the new democratic regime and incompetence"" and, according to criteria set forth ""a little later by the government,"" dismissals were applied to those who had been members of ""the dictatorship's governmental elite; political police collaborators; leading members of either the MP, the LP or the single party; and the heads of the dictatorship's censorship board."" Decree Law 123 added ""individual political behavior before the fall of the authoritarian regime"" (Pinto 2006, 183). The purges coordinated by the CIMSR targeted various civil service sectors (Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc) and dismissed individuals because of their ""political behavior"" during the previous regime (while holding their current position or another position) or because they were members of the ""governmental elite,"" had collaborated with the political police, were leading members of certain parties or served on the censorship board (Pinto 2006, 183-85). Each ministry (Justice, Labor, etc) had its own purge commission, and all the commissions were coordinated by the CIMSR. During 1974-75, regulated and unregulated purges occurred alongside each other. By February In 1976, the CIMSR’s main task was reintegrating those individuals who had been purged illegally (Pinto 2006, 187). Decree Law 471 (14 June 1976) declared previous purges that did not adhere to due process ""null and void"" (Pinto 2006, 192). Between 1976 and 1980, many individuals who had been purged legally and illegally were reintegrated (Pinto 2006, 193). Victims of the purges formed the Movement for the Reintegration of the Unfairly Dismissed in 1976 and engaged in protest activity, but I find no evidence of challenges submitted to a legal body (Pinto 2006, 192).

This law acted to declassify files on people from various sectors scientists, public officials, politicians, clergymen/women, and journalists who acted as secret police agents during the past regime (Zimonjic, 2006). It provides for the publication of nearly all files that identify politicians, public officials, scientists, judges, church officials and journalists as secret police agents in the communist era. A nine-member declassification committee decides on the declassification and disclosure of files. ""This law gives the power to a special de classification committee to open such dossiers and decide which documents will be archived and remain classified. Files on employees of the intelligence service and the defense ministry will remain classified"" (Zimonjic, 2006). The law has enforceable employment consequences. In April 2007, the Committee for Disclosing the Documents and Announcing Affiliation of Bulgarian Citizens to the State Security and the Intelligence Services of the Bulgarian National Army (the Kostadinov Committee) was established to implement the new law. Between 2007-2017, the Committee reviewed more than 200,000 individuals, including prime and deputy ministers, MPs, employees in the presidential administration, mayors, and municipal councilor candidates for local elections, ministers, ambassadors, and “opinion-makers from among journalists and civil society representatives. There is an appeals process.

30,255,0,,Stasi Records/File Law (1991)/Stasi File Law (Stasi-Unterlagengesetz),,"On December 29th, 1991, the Law on the Records of the State Security Service of the Former German Democratic Republic (or Stasi Records Law, Stasi-Unterlagengesetz) was passed by the unified German Parliament as direct legislation. This law acts organize, sort, and reconstruct Stasi files of its members and those of whom files and records were kept in the Former German Democratic Republic (Werle and Vormbaum, 305, 2012; Wilke, 372-373, 2007). Interestingly, this law, acting to respect the basic principles, is a ""duplicate"" law of an act originally passed in August 1990 by the then-active German Democratic Republic Parliament, acting to “validate” the 1990 law in the new, unified Germany. Like the law of 1990, this law acted to declassify Stasi files, but it was done in a unique manner. Instead of releasing all files, it called for the releasing of specific files depending on who is the requesting party: victims, past-Stasi informers, researchers, or public sector employers (Wilke, 372-373, 2007). Public sector employers—many being churches; political parties; parliaments and governments at local, state, and federal level; associations; public universities; and employers for lay judges, lawyers, and notary publics—could request files of those seeking employment. However, only files from 1975 onward would be considered for release to employers—unless files from before 1975 showed ""…crimes or violations of basic principles of humanity"" (Kritz, 621, 1993; Wilke, 373-374, 2007). Furthermore, those who took active involvement in the Stasi or committed crimes against humanity can be dismissed from their position (Pendas, 196, 2013). The law was created to expire in 2006. However, in December of that year, the Bundestag extended the laws validity to 2011. There has been a decline in requests for documents. Nevertheless, there were 6.4 million inquiries from the laws implementation in 1991 to 2009, and in 2008 alone, there were almost 84,000 requests. (Pendas, 197, 2013). It is unknown if there is an appeals process. However, those being vetted do receive a notification when a request is made by an employer for their file, and in some cases, consent is needed (Wilke, 373, 2007). As the law has been extended from 2006 to 2011, it can be considered to have been in full legal standing during its implementation. The policy scope, affecting many people from high-level MPs and executive officials all the way down to local clergymen, is not known to have changed (Wilke, 373, 2007).",1991,2019,Legislature/Parliament,legislative act,Yes (fully or partially),,challenged in court with unclear outcome,1,"""KNAUTH v.

Latvia’s Citizenship Law (1994) also limited the ability of non-Latvians to participate in political life. There were explicit lustration-type limitations on naturalization, forbidding the naturalization of individuals who propagated communist ideas, or “have been employees, informers, agents, or safe house keepers of the U.S.S.R.

15,355,0,,Panev Law [Law on the Temporary Introduction of Additional Requirements for Members of Executive Bodies of Scientific Organizations and the Higher Certifying Commission],1992-12-09,"On 9 December 1992, the National Assembly of Bulgaria adopted the Law for Temporary Introduction of Additional Requirements for Members of the Executive Bodies of the Scientific Organizations and the Higher Certifying Commission (also known as the ""Panev Law"") through legislation (Kritz, 700-1, 1995). This policy declares mainly in Article 3 the requirement that ""only those individuals may hold positions in the executive bodies of scientific organizations and the Higher Certifying Commission who can show that they"" have met many numerous requirements. Those that held positions at such institutions during the law's enactment must also submit a statement regarding their prior employment; if they refuse, it will be taken as failing one or more of the listed requirements for employment (Kritz, 701, 1995). The ban of academic members was set to only last through 1997, and there is no known appeals process (Kritz, 701, 1995). This law, though, did face opponents. President Zhelev, after signing the bill, joined 102 members of the National Assembly in petitioning the Constitutional Court to rule on the constitutionality of many other articles throughout the law (Helsinki, 10-13, 1993). On February 19th, 1993, the Constitutional Court found in a six to five decision that the law does not violate the Constitution, ""…defining the provisions of the law as merely 'additional requirements'"" (Helsinki, 11, 1993). However, in 1995, the law was repealed when the Socialist Party of Bulgaria (BSP) won an absolute majority in the elections. (Sadurski, 248, 2005). It must be noted that throughout the whole time of its implementation, only one institution had not acted on this law: the History Department at Sofia University. (Kritz, 704, 1995). The Panev Law was essentially self implemented, as candidates withdrew themselves from consideration, and university administrations removed compromised individuals from their institutions. The law ""had a direct impact on the ability of academic bodies to determine… who their leaders will be"" (Helsinki, 13, 1993). However, the law was repealed in 1995 after the 1994 elections resulted in an absolute majority by the Socialist Party of Bulgaria (BSP) (Sadursky, 248, 2005). Thus, one can assume that it had been at least partially implemented.",1992,1995,Legislature/Parliament,legislative act,Yes (fully or partially),Members of the National Assembly and President Zhelev immediately challenged the law in the Constitutional Court but it was upheld.,court challenge did not modify the policy,,"""Bulgaria's Politics: A wrangle over revealing communist-era secrets.""

A wide range of public offices were subject to the Lustration Law, covering all elected or appointed positions in the state administration, the judiciary, the army and the media (Keesings, 1991, pg 38449). This included the Ministry of Defense, all ranks of the judiciary/prosecution office, the civil service, rank of head of department and higher and senior administrative positions in all constitutional bodies, the army and police force positions of colonel and higher, all intelligence service concerning political surveillance and persecutions, positions in the national bank, state media, press agencies, state corporations and universities (Priban, 2007, pg 311; Stan and Nedelsky, 2013 Volume II, pg 135). Those disqualified from the above positions were Communist Party Officials from the district level up, Communist Party Militia, secret police/intelligence services (Officers in the Corps of National Security), and secret police collaborators (Priban, 2007, pg 311). The law also screened for members of purge committees in 1948 and 1968, students at KGB schools, and owners of StB 'conspiration apartments'(Stan, 2009, pg 250). If the accused's case results in positive lustration, they can file an administrative complaint with the ministry. If the original ruling is unchanged, they can file a civil suit against the ministry demanding the protection of ""personal integrity"" (Priban, 2007, pg 314). There was a procedural guarantee; the persons accused may ""appeal to a competent body established in accordance with national practice"" (Kritz, 1995, pg 327 volume III) (Cited from Convention 4 of the Screening Law). The law required an appeals body separate from the administrative or governmental authority, guaranteeing objectivity and independence. The accused have to right to present his/hers case in full (Kritz, 1995, pg 327 volume III). The scope changed in October of 1992 when The Constitutional Court of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic annulled a special category, secret police collaborators after ninety-nine members of parliament complained to the court. However, the court upheld the law's constitutionality as a whole, despite annulling this section of the law (Priban, 2007, pg 313). The Law was extended multiple times in the Czech Republic: in 1996, it was extended for another five years in September of 1995, and again in October of 2000 indefinitely, despite President Havel's veto (This extension was approved by the Constitutional Court in December of 2001)(Stan, Nedelsky, 2013, pg 135). This last extension introduced an exemption from the lustration process for people born after December 1, 1971 (Priban, 2007, pg 315).",1991,1992,Legislature/Parliament,legislative act,Yes (fully or partially),,court challenge modified the policy,"473,398 investigated by 2009 (throughout various spells of the original policy)","""Czechoslovakia.""

114,92,0,,Peace Accords: armed forces and national police,,"The January 1992 the Peace Accord between the Salvadoran government and FMLN rebels provided for the creation of an Ad Hoc Commission (AHC) to vet high-ranking military officers (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 88-9). The AHC began functioning on May 19, 1992 (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 94). Only high-ranking officers were vetted (with the exception of captains ""implicated"" during the investigation of others) (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 91) and considerations included, in part, respect for human rights (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 83). The AHC was supposed to operate for three months but its mandate was extended one month (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 94). It relied on reports prepared by an NGO (El Rescate) about officers' violations, as well as interviews with the officers themselves. Its final report (September 1992) was not made public but its findings became an ""open secret."" It recommended the transfer or dismissal of 103 officers as well as the minister and vice-minister of defense (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 95). There was not an appeals process as recommendations were ""non-negotiable"" (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 90). By the original deadline (December 1992), the government had dismissed or transferred most of the officers listed (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 94). By July 1993, the UN reported the government's ""broad compliance"" with AHC recommendations (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 95). This was a one-time process and is therefore not in force today. The January 1992 peace accords between the Salvadoran government and FMLN rebels provided for the dissolution of the FMLN (rebel guerilla group) and National Police (PN) and replaced the latter with a new National Civilian Police (PNC). Members of both FMLN and PN were eligible to join to PNC, the PNC could only be made up of 20% FMLN and 20% PN, and initial vetting of applicants was required (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 93). Group affiliation (PN, FMLN) put restrictions (in the form of a quota) on application to the PNC. PN applicants were then evaluated, in part, on their ‘conduct’ by the newly created National Public Security Academy and this evaluation was verified by ONUSAL (the UN mission in El Salvador) (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 88, 93). I find no evidence of an appeals process. ""Defective screening procedures"" resulted in imperfect implementation, but no particular aspect of the policy went unimplemented (Zamora and Holiday 2007, 98-99).

Against Spinola's wishes, this purge expanded to affect more officers. Special military commissions were established to carry out the dismissals requested by the MFA. ""Collaboration with the old regime"" was the original criteria, but this was replaced with ""incompetence"" to make the purges easier to carry out. The MFA issued Decree Law 147C on 21 March 1975, calling for officers to be placed on reserve if they did not ""obey the principles espoused by the MFA."" These purges were mostly complete by 1976 (Pinto 2006, 182). Purged officers were ""deported"" (Pinto 2006, 179), ""removed from active duty,"" and ""placed on reserve"" (Pinto 2006, 182).

51,368,0,,Law No. I-2115 (Declassification of Deputies),1991-12-17,"In 1991, the Lithuanian parliament passed a law intended to prevent former employees and collaborators with the Soviet secret police and intelligence services (including, but not limited to, the KGB) from serving as parliamentary deputies. In 1992, the policy was expanded to cover all currently serving elected officials at the local and national level (Kritz 1995, 767-769). The law created a parliamentary committee charged with reviewing KGB records to identify deputies who were serving in the current government. These individuals were notified of their lustrated status and allowed to admit their collaboration or to appeal the committee's decision. Appeals of MPs went directly to the Lithuanian Supreme Court, while those of lower officials were handled by the courts of appeals. Those persons who admitted to past secret police association (or whose appeals were overruled) were subjected to a recall election. The ballot informed voters that the person was a known collaborator and asked whether or not his or her mandate should be renewed. In addition, the individual could resign at any point in the process. Thus, the only official sanction was declassification; however, it was expected that former collaborators would be forced out of government. A lustration committee was established and individuals were screened. Several high-profile cases, including the founder of one of the post-transition leftist parties, were lustrated (Kritz 1995, 767-769). However, implementation was problematic due to the KGB's partial success in removing or destroying files (Nalepa 2010, 201-2).",1991,1999,Legislature/Parliament,legislative act,Yes (fully or partially),"Horne (2017) says: lustration policies were effectively blocked when the author of the lustration bill was himself identified by the press as a former KGB agent, and the successor to the Lithuanian Communist Party won the 1992 parliamentary elections (Stan 2009, 231; RFE/RL 1998, June 29). As a result, despite the formal public disclosure rules and formal employment bans associated with lustration, they remained unimplemented in practice.

Without any true legal sanctions, this law acted as declassification for those exposed as collaborators. The Law is dubbed Ticu Law, after its initiator – former political detainee, Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu. The Law was launched with the purpose of sole disclosure of agents and collaborators of 'Securitate (secret police) as a political police'.

42,645,0,,De-Baathification,,"On May 16 2003, the Coalition Provisional Authority established a de-Baathification policy through Order No. 1, ""De-Ba'athification of Iraqi Society,"" in order to purge public administration posts of senior party members of the Baath Party (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 11). On August 18 2003, the Iraqi Governing Council established the Higher National De-Baathification Commission (HNDC) to administer de-Baathification and expanded somewhat the scope of the policy: de-Baathification would now affect positions in state bureaucracy, politics, civil institutions, and the media, disqualifying those who had been party members from the level of Uda Ferqa or higher, senior-level civil servants, members of ""oppressive institutions,"" and those guilty of ""stealing national wealth, aggression, and other crimes"" (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 12). The HNDC also changed the appeals process, making the procedures less transparent (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 13). De-Baathification provisions were included in the 2005 Constitution, banning those targeted from positions in the Presidency Council, Prime Ministership, Parliament and their equivalents at the state level. Also in 2005, the HNDC began barring candidates from running for office and dismissing judges serving on the Iraqi High Tribunal (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 15). In 2006, the work of the HNDC began to focus more on reinstatement of banned persons (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 23). Reform measures were proposed in Parliament in 2007, and in 2008, the Accountability and Justice Law was passed, creating the Accountability and Justice Commission (AJC) to replace the HNDC and instituting some minimal reforms of the de-Baathification system. Some changes ""on paper"" included: most Ferqa-level members were allowed to return to government positions; an independent appeals body was created; a ""more aggressive stance"" was taken against those who had served in Baath intelligence agencies (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 18-19). The AJC got involved in the January 2010 elections, working to disqualify from candidacy former Baath Party members, former members of secret intelligence and security institutions, and those who had ""promoted"" the Baath Party (Sissons and Al-Saiedi 2013, 19-20).",2003,,Other,executive other,,,court challenge modified the policy,,"Sattar, Omar.

This law was imposed on a variety of positions, including President of the Republic, MPs, senators, judges, procurators, advocates, and people holding key positions in Polish Public Television, Polish Public Radio, the Polish Press Agency, and the Polish Information Agency (Czarnota, 2007, pg 232). The law consists of two sections: Part A asks for a declaration of complicity with the secret services. Part B asks for details of this collaboration in the event of a positive statement. These names become public, but without their associated acts of collaboration. Those who admit to collaboration can still hold office. The law does not punish collaboration itself, but only a lie concerning collaboration (Czarnota, 2007, pg 232-3). ""The Statutory requirement for holding public office is moral qualification to do so"" (Czarnota, 237). If an untrue lustration declaration is declared, individuals currently in office automatically lose their position, lose moral qualification to hold public office and are banned from holding one for ten years (Czarnota, 2007, pg 237). Within fourteen days of the judgment, parties can appeal the decision of the Lustration Court by three professional judges. After this decision, parties have a right to cassation by the Supreme Court within three months (Czarnota, 2007, pg 236-7). Commissioner Nizienski was criticized for emphasizing this law on judges and advocates, which was seen as an act of vengeance on professional groups. An amendment was passed, stating that verification should be carried out in order of state positions listed in article 17, beginning with the most important (ministers for example) (Czarnota, 2007, pg 238-9). June 1998, an amendment created the Lustration Court after the failure to establish an institutional structure for the lustration of MP and senatorial candidates before the parliamentary elections of September 21, 1997(Czarnota, 2007, pg 242).

Act No. 553/2002, known as the ""Law on National Memory"", states its rationale and purposes in its preamble, which include ""the duty to prosecute crimes against peace, humanity and war crimes,"" ""the duty of our state to achieve satisfaction for those were damaged by the state, which violated human rights and its own laws,"" ""the duty of our state to disclose the activity of repressive authorities” (Stan and Nedelsky 2013, 438). The Law set up an Institute for National Memory where people can access files of the state security services, a form of declassification. It was also tasked with investigating and publicizing the repressive aspects of the state’s fascist and communist past (Stan and Nedelsky 2013, 438) The UPN (The Institute for National Memory) has done little to ensure the prosecution of past crimes, but has been successful and influential in illuminating the acts committed by the previous regime (Stan and Nedelsky 2013, 438). Lists of names were indeed published, and in some cases, named individuals stepped down from their posts, resulting in a sort of ""self-lustration"" (Nedelsky 2009, 56). The UPN project suffered when Langos was killed in a car crash in June 2006, and its many opponents in government took the opportunity to try to undermine its future. However, it eventually gained new leadership and has continued its activities, and still has legal standing today (Stan and Nedelsky 2013, 438). Starting in 2007, the UPN expanded to a disclosure based approach as it was legally allowed to provide file access to anyone, including the press.

113,350,0,,Dejuntafication of the Greek government,,"There was a widespread dejuntification of the central and local government, military, police and security forces, judiciary, and academia. With regard to the public sector, the following were dismissed by the transitional government within a few weeks of the July 24 1974 transition: all general secretaries of ministries and all prefects and province governors; all presidents and general directors of public bodies, state-run companies and state-owned banks; all mayors and members of town councils who had been appointed by the junta (Sotiropoulos 2007, 129-130). No official decree or legislation associated with this policy. The sole basis of dismissals was that those purged had worked for the previous regime (Sotiropoulos 2007, 130). Between the August and November 1974, the transitional government removed eleven military generals through the Supreme National Defense Council (an existing body authorized to promote and retire military officers), but there doesn't appear to have been an official decree associated with this action (Sotiropoulos 2007, 128). This vetting was part of wider ""dejuntafication"" efforts (Sotiropoulos 2007, 125). In addition to the eleven generals affected, an ""unverified number"" of lower-ranking officers were temporarily suspended (Sotiropoulos 2007, 128). Overall, vetting criteria included whether the officer held a high-ranking position immediately before the fall of the junta or whether the officer was involved in the coup that led to the takeover of the junta in the first place (Sotiropoulos 2007, 128). After an attempted coup by some officers in February 1975, the (elected) government forced 500 military officers into early retirement and transferred 600-800 to different posts (Sotiropoulos 2007, 137). It's unclear what vetting criteria were used for this widespread purge. In August 1974, the transitional government started replacing, reassigning and ""pensioning off"" police and security personnel who either held high-ranking positions under the junta or were known human rights violators. The prime ministers and other ministers of the transitional government made these decisions. A government was democratically elected in November 1974. Vetting continued at least through 1975. In mid-summer 1974, the transitional government dismissed the chiefs of the urban police and gendarmerie, the intelligence service and National Security Service because of these officers' association with the previous regime. Some lower-ranking officers in these bodies were reassigned to an inactive status because of their particularly bad human rights records. After an attempted coup in February 1974, a greater number of police officers were forced to retire (Sotiropoulos 2007, 138). An estimated 92 officers were purged in total (Sotiropoulos 2007, 139). Greece's judicial vetting policy is made up by four different pieces of legislation issued by the transitional government: (1) Constitutional Act of August 7, 1974 [called for the reinstatement of the Highest Disciplinary Council (HDC), a pre-junta institution], (2) Constitutional Act of September 5, 1974 [called for the reinstitution of judges who had been dismissed by the junta and for the vetting (by the HDC) of judges promoted by the junta to the posts of president and vice president in the country's three highest courts, and established vetting criteria and sanctions], (3) Constitutional Act of September 24, 1974 [modified the procedures of the September 5 Act, but only in that the task of restituting junta-purged judges was moved to the cabinet (had been the responsibility of the service councils of the judiciary)], (4) Legislative Decree of September 30, 1974 [further determined ""organizational aspects"" of the HDC including that there would be no right to appeal its decisions] (Sotiropoulos 2007, 130-132). The unelected transitional government issued three acts relevant to vetting of academics, which itself was part of a wider ""dejuntafication"" campaign (Sotiropoulos 2007, 125). The Constitutional Act of September 3, 1974 called for the rehiring of professors dismissed by the junta and for the establishment of the Special Disciplinary Council (SDC) to vet certain categories of academics and set criteria for academic vetting. According to the September 3 Act, professors could be vetted if they 1) were appointed by the junta to a public sector post between 1967 and 1974, 2) had sided with the junta inside the university system (e.g. by denouncing left-wing students or sitting on junta-staffed bodies), 3) had been appointed/elected to university posts previously held by junta-purged academics, or 4) were lower-level professors hired after 1967 (Sotiropoulos 2007, 134-35). Presidential Decree 652/1974 appointed the nine members of the SDC. Legislative Decree 88/1974 reversed certain provisions of the September 3 Act so that academics could only be vetted if they were shown to be active supporters of the junta, not simply if they were appointed by the junta.",1974,1975,,executive other,Yes (fully or partially),,don't know,,"Sotiropoulos, Dimitri A.

61,840,0,,Dismissal of military leadership,,"In 1986, new Philippines president Corazon Aquino forced several dozen military officers, including 23 generals, into mandatory retirement. Military officials with ""personal loyalty to Ferdinand Marcos"" (Nalepa, ""Lustration Report"", 29) would likely have been in the chain of command for human rights abuses committed during his regime. A presidential commission on human rights, also created by Aquino, reported that violations of physical integrity were perpetrated by Marcos' military (Burgess 1986). However, other sources report that the dismissals served to ""strengthen [Aquino's] control over the military"" in a struggle for political power (Cumming-Bruce 1986), or were carried out under pressure from the United States (Crossette 1986). I can find no evidence of an official language in a decree or law. This appears to be a one-time, quasi-formal policy. In addition to the retirement of generals, there was ""widespread replacement of battalion and brigade commanders,"" although there is no evidence that this group was banned permanently (Nalepa, ""Lustration Report,"" 29). I can find no evidence of challenges to this policy, nor an appeals process (although Nalepa notes that Aquino's chief of armed forces, Fidel Ramos, successfully delayed some retirements).",1986,,Executive,executive other,,,don't know,,"Burgess, John.

This law acts to vet all judges and magistrates holding positions during its passing for, among other causes, their history with human rights, removing them from their position if found to be in violation of Articles 10 and 159 of the recent Constitution of Kenya which define various ethical standards for various position-holders, including human rights (Constitution of Kenya; Judges and Magistrates Vetting Board; Africareview.com, 2012). Although those found in violation are removed from office, it is unknown if there is a ban on holding any future positions. Furthermore, due to an amendment added to the bill, those vetted will not have the ability to appeal the decision (Africareview.com, 2012). However, the law or parts of it have been challenged twice.

46,347,0,45,UNMIK Administrative Direction 2008/2,2008-01-17,"On January 17, 2008, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo adopted Administrative Direction No. 2008/2. This set the vetting guidelines for the Independent Judicial and Prosecutorial Commission (IJPC), an established autonomous body of the Kosovo Judicial Council (KJC), in selections to fill the Kosovar Judicial Branch (Administrative Direction 2008/2, 2008, 1-12). This policy is self-sustaining, apart from the reference to the earlier Regulation No. 2005/52. Interestingly, Regulation No. 2005/52 was created as a guideline for appointing officers to the KJC, those who will be choosing those to fill various positions of the Kosovar Judicial Branch. Administration Direction No. 2008/2 calls for those being appointed to meet, among other basic criteria, section six of Regulation No. 2005/52 , which calls for, among other things, applicants to be ""...of high moral integrity and not have been engaged in discriminatory practices as defined by law and judicial rules and procedures..."" (Administrative Direction 2008/2, 2008, 5; Regulation 2005/52, 2005, 6-7). This policy, calling for an invitation for applicants by a public announcement, opens the possibility of a wide spectrum of positions to apply for consideration (Administrative Direction 2008/2, 2008, 3). Section 6 of this direction outlines an appeals process. Those who fail to meet eligibility requirements for various reasons or are not selected can, within 15 days from notification by the IJPC, apply for reconsideration, based on one or more reasons: the decision was based ""on material errors or omissions,"" there is new important information not previously known/available at the time of decision, or there was a serious procedural error or omission in following the guidelines by this Administrative Direction (Administrative Decision 2008/2, 2008, 7-8). Of the 394 positions filled, sixty percent of people assigned to the before-mentioned positions are new to their position. Nevertheless, because of its young age it is unknown if this Administrative Decision has had any challenges or if any aspects have been outlawed, overruled, or cancelled for any reason. Thus, we cannot define the level of its implementation at this time. However, it's important to that the end of the IJPC mandate coincided with the formal transfer of judicial vetting functions to the Kosovo Judicial Council, which is now responsible for identification, screening and appointment of judges and prosecutors, to ensure their performance, integrity and discipline (Kosovo Legal Professional Program).",2008,2023,Other,treaty / intl mission,Yes (fully or partially),,don't know,,"Administrative Direction No. 2008/2, 3 C.F.R. 12.

12,346,0,9,Quasi-formal & NATO vets police/military,2004-06-30,"High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lord Paddy Ashdown dismissed 60 officials from the leadership of the Republika Srpska (Bosnian Serb entity) on June 30, 2004 for allegedly aiding Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and other indicted war criminals evade capture (Keesings, 2004, pg 46087). The Office of the High Representative (OHR) is an ad hoc international institution responsible for overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the Peace Agreement ending the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, created through the Dayton Peace Accords (OHR Introduction, Office of the High Representative, www.ohr.int). The Peace Accords gave the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina the right, known as the Bonn Powers, to remove civil servants from public office for reasons ranging from their war time records to interfering with the implementation of the peace process (Stan and Nedelsky, 2013, pg 63). Ashdown's motives stemmed from an attempt to ""get rid of the cancer of obstructionism and corruption""(Keesing, 2004, pg 46087). President of the Serb Democratic Party, (SDS) Dragan Kalinic was dismissed as Speaker of the People’s Assembly (legislative body of the Republika Srpska), and Zoran Djeric was dismissed as Republika Srpska Interior Minister. High-ranking SDS officials, businessmen, senior military, police and intelligence officials were also dismissed (Keesings, 2004, pg 46087).

54,343,0,,Lustration Law,,"The Macedonian parliament passed a lustration law, its first effort at vetting, in 2008. The law conforms to recommendations that Macedonia address ""the heritage of [the] former communist totalitarian system"" that was responsible for many abuses (Council of Europe 2013, 28). Under the terms of the original law, names of individuals who had been employed by or cooperated with former intelligence services were to be published in the Macedonian Official Gazette. The President of Macedonia, members of parliament and their staff, and judges were required to undergo lustration investigations (Bohnet and Bojadzieva 2011, 68). The law also included numerous non-governmental professions, including journalists, clergy, and NGO activists, although these provisions were eventually struck down by the Constitutional Court (Council of Europe 2013, 28). The lustration commission has investigated several hundred individuals. However, it has faced shortages of funding and staff, and concerns about its effectiveness were raised when an initial round of lustration found no collaborators among the ruling party (Bohnet and Bojadzieva 2011, 68). As of 2013, over 30 people had been declared former collaborators. Although several successfully appealed the Commission’s decision, concerns remain about due process (Council of Europe 2013, 29). The Constitutional Court has, on multiple occasions, limited the scope of the law. It ruled that lustration could not be applied to many non-governmental professions; it limited the historical period in question to the Communist era (1945-1991); and it ruled against the automatic publishing of names, due to concerns about privacy rights (Council of Europe 2013, 28-29; Marusic 2012; Bohnet and Bojadzieva 2011, 67). These decisions have resulted in a much weaker law. Most importantly, the lustration Commission no longer has a mandate for sanctions. It is noted that ""the appropriate court can ban [lustrated individuals] from taking public office,"" but further evidence confirming a ban as part of the official policy was not present (Bohnet and Bojadzieva 2011, 67-68). In response, in 2012 the majority party in the Macedonian parliament submitted and approved a new lustration law very similar to the 2008 version. Its approval by the Macedonian President was met with controversy, and it faces renewed Constitutional Court challenges. As of the time of writing, the legal status of lustration in Macedonia is uncertain (Marusic 2012; Council of Europe 2013, 29-30). The Constitutional Court has, on multiple occasions, limited the scope of the law, saying it could not be applied to many non-governmental professions, limiting the period in question to the Communist era, and ruling against the publishing of names due to privacy concerns.",2008,2012,Legislature/Parliament,legislative act,Yes (fully or partially),,court challenge modified the policy,324,"Bohnet, Henri and Daniela Bojadzieva.

118,41,0,,Dismissals of military officers and vetting of interim police force,,"In 1991, the democratically-elected government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overthrown in a military coup. The military government, led by Raoul Cedras, committed numerous human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings. In 1994, the United States military invaded Haiti and restored Aristide to power. In late 1994 and early 1995, Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide retired or removed more than 30 top army officers (a different source counts 66 dismissals). Many were accused of human rights violations during the military regime. However, many of the same individuals were part of the coup that ousted Aristide in 1991, raising the possibility that the dismissals were politically motivated. After a few rounds of dismissals, all of Haiti's military officers above the rank of major had been dismissed or replaced (Hamilton Spectator 1 Dec 1994; Human Rights Watch 1995). No information is available regarding appeals processes or challenges to the policy. Later in 1995, the Haitian armed forces were disbanded entirely, also by executive fiat. However, that policy appears to have been separate from the quasi-formal dismissals discussed here: at the time he announced these dismissals, Aristide claimed that he could not abolish the military In 1991, the democratically elected government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overthrown in a military coup. The military government, led by Raoul Cedras, committed numerous human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings. In 1994, the United States military invaded Haiti and restored Aristide to power. Shortly thereafter, vetting procedures were instituted in order to assess candidates for an interim police force tasked with maintaining order. Also, as entrants to the training academy that would produce a permanent police force were vetted. Various sources confirm that the vetting procedures were intended to remove human rights violators from service (e.g. Human Rights Watch 1995, 6-7). The vetting policy and interim police force were a joint project of the Haitian government and the United States, Canada, and other international actors. However, various sources report that the policy was nominally headed by Haitian officials. For example, Aristide named a member of his cabinet to ""oversee the vetting process"" and that the commission charged with screening individual soldiers was chosen jointly by ""senior officials of the U.S. and Haitian governments"" (Washington Post, 27 Dec 1994; Washington Post, 9 Oct 1994; Human Rights Watch 1995, 12). There was no formal law, decree, or declaration of the policy, so it is best described as a ""quasi-formal"" policy. The interim police force was made up of former Haitian army soldiers. Initial plans suggested that approximately half of the Haitian military would be included in the new force (at the time of Aristide's return, Haitian armed forces numbered approximately 7,000). Individuals who had committed human rights violations were banned from According joining the new force (Human Rights Watch 1995, 12-14). A commission of high-ranking military officials was mandated with conducting the vetting. Agents of the commission visited army companies and ""conducted inquiries regarding the reputations of individual soldiers,"" including inquiries with local Haitian civilians and with soldiers' commanding officers. However, these procedures were significantly flawed: the commission lacked a mechanism to further investigate alleged abuses, nor is there any evidence of an appeals process for implicated individuals. Those who did not pass the commission's initial ""investigation"" were simply excluded (Human Rights Watch 1995, 12-14). It is estimated that less than 1,000 individuals were excluded from the interim force. As a result of the commission's poor implementation, several observers were concerned that many soldiers implicated in human rights abuses remained in the interim force (Human Rights Watch 1995).",1994,1995,,executive other,Yes (fully or partially),"Evidence of removal in December 1994.

25,366,0,,Disclosure Law,1995-02-06,"The 1995 Disclosure Act accompanied the Citizenship Law and established procedures to both identify and make public the names of individuals who worked for or collaborated with the KGB or Nazi security services. In 1995, a law established a process for ""securing information about, registering, and, whenever necessary, making public"" the names of agents and collaborators with secret police during both the Nazi and Soviet eras. Such persons were instructed to disclose their histories of involvement in writing to the Estonian Security Police Board before April 1, 1996; those who did so were forgiven and their names kept secret. Subsequent to the deadline, a commission investigated further claims and published the names of individuals implicated. Investigations and sanctions were not apparently related to the current position or status of targeted individuals (Pettai 2013, 164). The law included an appeals provision by which persons could challenge the charges against them in a confidential court (Pettai 2013, 164). No evidence is available describing the process in detail or documenting the scope of its practical use. Before the 1996 deadline for confidentiality, approximately 1,000 people registered with the Estonian authorities.

(""Comprehensive..."" 2003). UNMIL assumed this restructuring role (Fithen 2009, 14). Vettees were assessed based on their education qualifications, age, physical fitness, human rights records during the civil war, and criminal records (Fithen 2009, 15). 800 out of 3000 vettees passed and began retraining. Most of those who failed did so because of insufficient education qualifications. About 5% of those who failed were notified and given the opportunity to appeal. UNMIL processed these appeals. The vetting process took two years and is no longer an existing policy (Fithen 2009, 15). I find no evidence of challenges issued or if the ban on disqualified candidates was meant to be permanent. On August 18, 2003, the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) Between the Government of Liberia and the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL) and Political Parties was signed in Accra and included a provision concerning vetting of the judiciary (Article XXVII). According to Article XXVII, the Supreme Court (appointed under Charles Taylor's regime) would resign and the appointment of new judges by the transitional government with the approval of the transitional legislature (""Comprehensive…"" 2003). In practice, all judges in the lower courts as well as ""Associate and Stipendiary Magistrates"" were forced to resign (Fithen 2009, 9). Since the judges and magistrates were appointed under Charles Taylor, their dismissal is based on affiliation with the former regime. Criteria for appointment to judicial positions in the new government were based in part on a candidate's ability to ""demonstrate an ability to uphold internationally approved human rights standards,"" suggesting that past human rights violations could disqualify a candidate. Vetting made use of UNMIL integrity records compiled by the UNMIL Human Rights Office. (Fithen 2009, 8-9). Existing judges and magistrates were dismissed. Supreme Court judges were retired permanently, but others who were dismissed could (and did) seek nomination in order to apply for reinstatement (Fithen 2009, 9). There were no appeals processes or severance packages (Fithen 2009, 10). Resignations happened fully, and vetting, although imperfectly implemented, was near complete (Fithen 2009, 9-10).

29,255,0,,Unification Treaty,,"On August 31, 1990, the governments of the (Former) German Democratic Republic (East Germany, GDR) and the (Former) Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, FRG) signed the Unification Treaty, uniting the countries into one single Federal Republic of Germany. This treaty, among other things, called for the vetting of employees of the Former GDR (Wilke, 368, 2007). Paragraphs four and five of appendix I, chapter XIX, section III of the Unification Treaty call for the vetting and dismissal of public-sector employees based on one (or a combination) of three reasons. Paragraph four states that “ordinary” dismissals can occur within the public sector if there is a ""'lack of demand'"" for that employee or his or her position. Paragraph five calls for ""extraordinary"" dismissals (those without a notice in advance) for those who were active in the former Ministry for state Security or because the employee had ""'violated basic principles of humanity and the rule of law...guaranteed in the 1966 Convention on Civil and Political Rights….and…in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.'""These individuals aren't banned from future employment. Rather, future employment is dependent on an individual, case by case basis of said individuals, creating a public sector that is personally suitable and ""…(subscribes) to the principles of the (new) Constitution."" It must also be added that this vetting process occurred in various degrees. The universities, wanting to be seen as centers of academia and intelligence, widened their scope and their standards were stricter, while police (Wilke, 368-370 , 2007). The clause on ""lack of demand"" was set to expire in 1993, while the clause on ""extraordinary"" dismissal does not have a known set end date. It is unclear if there is an appeals process, but there has been at least one known case taken against a ruling based on this section Unification Treaty. In Knauth v. Germany, a former nursery-school teacher sued against her dismissal, which was caused by her admittance of past-involvement with the former State Security (Wilke, 368-370, 2007; Knauth, 2001). A slight change, though, in the jurisprudence of paragraph five emerged. From 1992 to 1996, the interpretations shifted towards ""principles that were careful to limit dismissals to persons who had committed exceptional and harmful misconduct…."" This law can be considered to have been fully implemented, having full-legal standing through its legal existence and affecting a wide range of individuals of the former German Democratic Republic (Wilke, 368-372, 2007). In 1993, one of the grounds for possible dismissal ceased - that pertaining to the “ordinary” dismissal is possible for pure lack of demand for the employee or the “lack of professional qualification” or “lack of personal suitability.” This category pertained to ""the disproportionately large staff.""",1990,,Legislature/Parliament,treaty / intl mission,Yes (fully or partially),"It must be noted that the jurisprudence regarding ""extraordinary"" bans shifted to Principles that were careful to limit dismissals to persons who had committed exceptional and harmful misconduct..."".

The policy was an attempt to address ""how wealth was squandered and power abused"" by previous governments, suggesting both corruption and human rights violations as possible motivations for the decision (The Guardian, 26 Sep 1987). The ban affected former politicians as well as current and former military members who have held office (including Babangida himself) since Nigeria's 1960 independence from Britain. ""A wide range of senior office-holders during Nigeria's two periods of civilian rule, as well as military and police personnel in the current Administration"" were banned for five years, enough time to be excluded from all elections planned as part of the return to civilian rule. A lifetime ban from public office was received by ""anyone who was found guilty of corruption or other misdeeds"" since 1960 (Globe and Mail 25 Sep 1987; The Guardian 26 Sep 1987). While in force, the ban was effective in preventing former politicians and military leaders from seeking office.

(Regulation 2005/52, 2005, 1). This regulation called for the creation of the Kosovo Judicial Council (KJC) and, as one of its many vetting policies, requires its chair holders to ""...be of high moral integrity and not have been engaged in discriminatory practices as defined by law and judicial rules and procedures..."" Interestingly, then, is the ban of those who committed violations without a specific date, time, or period (Regulation 2005/52, 2005, 7). This law defines seven members who are pre-approved to holding chair on this council. Those seven positions are: the President of the Supreme Court, the Minister of Justice; the President of the Kosovo Chamber of Advocates; the Chairperson of the Assembly Committee on Legislative, Judicial, and Constitutional Framework Matters; a professor of law; and four non-judges. Those four non-judges must meet the above stated policy as well as many more. Nevertheless, this regulation opens up the vetting to those holding many various positions, including legislative, judicial, public office, and others not already defined. (Regulation 2005/52, 2005, 3-7). The regulation does not state an appeals process, and it is unknown if there exists a case challenging its legality or the rulings made by its powers. However, one can assume that, because of the formation of Administrative Direction 2008/2 in 2008, this law has been at least partially implemented (Administrative Direction 2008/2, 2008, 1-12; Regulation 2005/52, 2005, 1-11).",2005,2023,Other,treaty / intl mission,Yes (fully or partially),,don't know,,"Administrative Direction No. 2008/2, 3 C.F.R. 12.

This policy was enacted on March 15, 2007 by the lower house of Polish Parliament, the Sejm (Febbrajo, Sadurski, 2010, pg 164). For those who do not sign a questionnaire or were found lying about their collaboration with secret services can be dismissed from their position and barred from holding public office for 10 years (Penketh, The Independent (London), 2007).

Many leading intellectuals and left-wing politicians defied the law. According to Polish media reports, government ministers applied huge pressure on the independent constitutional court (Scally, the Irish Times, 2007). The Polish Constitutional Court declared the law to be unconstitutional. The head of the constitutional court, Jerzy Stepian declared that ""The law cannot be used for revenge . . . the [SB] documents cannot be used for purposes other than protecting us from threats to democracy in the future"" (Scally, the Irish Times, 2007).

Against Spinola's wishes, this purge expanded to affect more officers. Special military commissions were established to carry out the dismissals requested by the MFA.

14,355,0,,Law on Banks and Credit Activity,1992-03-18,"On 18 March 1992, the Bulgarian Parliament adopted ""Transitional and Concluding Provisions of the Law for Banks and Credit"" through legislation. The law included a provision for lustrating members of the former Communist regime (Ellis, 188, 1996). Although numerous human rights violations occurred under the previous regime, it is unclear whether or not the lustration provision in the Banking Law was motivated by past abuses or political reasons. At least one source suggests that lustration in the Banking Law was part of the broader electoral strategy of the anticommunist UDF party (Kolarova 1996). This policy is an act of banning from future employment in the banking system those with membership or affiliation with the past Communist regime. Targeted individuals included those who had been members of the Communist Party and various affiliated political groups, such as trade unions, as well as former employees and collaborators with security forces. These individuals were banned from being elected or appointed to ""executive positions"" in banks. The ban would have been in effect for five years (Helsinki Watch, 5-6, 1993; The Economist, 2007). The ban, however, had been set up to last for only five years (Helsinki Watch, 5-6, 1993). There is no known appeals process, and the life of this law was short only lasting from its passing on March 4, 1992 to the court's ruling on June 12, 1992. Forty-nine members of the National Assembly submitted a petition for the Constitutional Court to rule on its constitutionality, arguing that ""'All citizens shall be equal before the law. There shall be no privileges or restrictions of rights on the grounds of. . . opinion, political affiliation . . .' (and that) The petition also challenged the Banking Law as a violation of international human rights documents which are considered part of Bulgaria's domestic legislation,"" Interestingly, the Court called upon both domestic law (the Bulgarian Constitution) and international treaties to which Bulgaria was a signatory to make its decision (Helsinki Watch, 6-7, 1993; Ellis, 188, 1996).",1992,1992,Legislature/Parliament,legislative act,No,,court challenge ended the policy,,"""Bulgaria's Politics: A wrangle over revealing communist-era secrets.""

While one draft of the law proposed the creation of an independent commission to carry out lustration, the final version empowered the Ministry of Internal Affairs with that responsibility, raising concerns about politicization of the process (Sherlock 2013, 190). More complete information about the lustration process and its implementation was unavailable at the time of writing. No information was found about an appeals process. The law would exclude “former Communist Party functionaries and officers of and collaborators with the ex-Soviet secret service KGB from serving in the state structures” (Civil Georgia 2010).",2011,2015,Legislature/Parliament,legislative act,Yes (fully or partially),"The law created a commission to openly list those who have collaborated with or had relations with intelligence agencies of the USSR, who continue to hold high positions in the government.

This lustration law mandated that a wide range of public officials be investigated to determine whether they had committed human rights violations. The law applied to violations committed at any point after 23 March 1976, the day when the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into effect (Dimitrijevic 2013, 423). Individuals to be lustrated included a comprehensive list of government positions in the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. Both high- (e.g., the President) and low-ranking (e.g. members of provincial assemblies) members were subject to lustration. Officials in the army and police forces were also included (Resanovic 2005, 69-70). The law created a commission to assess persons for their individual accountability to human rights violations. Individuals who had committed violations were prevented from holding any of the affected positions for a period of up to 5 years (U.S. Department of State 2003, 1563). The law provides accused individuals with the right to a secret hearing in which the relevant evidence may be presented. As the law was never implemented, it is difficult to ascertain whether or not the hearings would have been effective in providing due process. Members of Parliament opposed to the law were able to prevent its implementation by refusing to elect the commission that was to oversee the lustration process (Dimitrijevic 2013, 423).

My sources offer a few different reasons for the purge, including the abuses carried out by the military (Rupert 1999, A12) and Obasanjo's desire to consolidate his power, subordinate the military to civilian government, reduce corruption, and support democracy (""Nigeria"" 1999, 42984; Gordon 2003, 257). Hundreds of military officers were retired if they previously held positions as ""ministers, state governors, heads of government agencies and state-owned companies"" (Rupert 1999, A12) or if they were ""members of the former provisional ruling council during the Abacha regime"" (Gordon 2003, 257). This appears to be a one-time policy, but Obasanjo did also conduct a smaller purge a few years later (April 2002) when he replaced the chiefs of the army, navy, and air force (Gordon, 2003 257). Gordon states that this purge, along with the 1999 purge, were aimed at consolidating power and ""undermine Hausa-Fulani dominance of the military"" (Gordon 2003, 257).

According to the September 3 Act, professors could be vetted if they 1) were appointed by the junta to a public sector post between 1967 and 1974, 2) had sided with the junta inside the university system (e.g. by denouncing left-wing students or sitting on junta-staffed bodies), 3) had been appointed/elected to university posts previously held by junta-purged academics, or 4) were lower-level professors hired after 1967 (Sotiropoulos 2007, 134-35). Presidential Decree 652/1974 appointed the nine members of the SDC.

173,369,0,,Law On Restoring Trust in the Judicial System,2014-04-8,"The Lustration of Judges Law aimed at reviving the judiciary's credibility by conducting special screening of judges involved in rendering court decisions that encroached on the rights of Euromaidan demonstrators. For this, a Temporary Special Commission under the auspices of the High Council of Justice was established to run the special screening and issue conclusions on whether the actions of a particular judge constitute violations of their oath, disciplinary or criminal offenses. If the violations are found, the conclusion is sent to a responsible body to decide on the judge’s potential dismissal (the High Council of Justice for a violation of the oath; the High Council of Justice or the High Qualification Commission of Judges for a disciplinary offense; and the Prosecutor General Office for criminal offenses). The judges can challenge their dismissal in court. The process is individualized and concerns each judge's potentially unlawful individual conduct. In addition to the special screening, “final and transitional” provisions of the Lustration of Judges Law encompassed the blanket dismissal of all court chairs, ensuring fair electability of such positions by the judges of each court by secret ballot (many of those chairs were reelected) and the premature dismissal of the High Council of Justice and the High Qualification Commission of Judges members.

40,310,0,,Lustration Act XXIII - Law on the Background Checks of Individuals Holding Certain Important Positions,1994-03-08,"Act XXIII was passed by Parliament in March 1994, and subsequent revision/modification laws were passed in 1996 (Act LXVII) and 2000 (Act XCIII) (Barrett et al 2007). The vetting procedure (carried out by lustration commissions, each composed of three judges) sought to establish whether vettees had engaged in certain activities during the previous regime. Section 1 of the 1994 law defines activities of concern: 1) serving as career officers, top-secret officers or network members of III/III, 2) being in a position in which they received information collected by III/III, 3) being a member of the fascist Arrow Cross Party, 4) serving as a detachment police during the revolution of 1956 (Barrett et al 2007, 269). None of these activities concerns direct responsibility for human rights violations. The law gives vettees found to have committed these acts the choice between resigning their governmental post or having information about their past published (Barrett et al 2007, 269). None of these laws provides for the ban or dismissal of public officials (only their OPTION to resign). ""The implicit expectation was that most affected individuals would resign"" (Barrett et al 2007, 269-270). Individuals had opportunities to appeal decisions before information was revealed to the public (Barrett et al 2007, 270). The 1994 law targeted a wide swath of government employees: members of Parliament and the Government; President and Vice President of the national bank; ambassadors; army commanders, president, vice president and editor of national radio, TV and news service; chiefs of police; presidents, deans, general directors, and department heads of state-owned universities and colleges; career judges; district attorneys; editors of daily newspapers and weekly magazines; directors of state-owned agencies; managers of state-owned banks, financial institutions, and insurance companies (Ellis 1996, 183-184). There was a petition to the Hungarian Constitutional Court that resulted in that Court declaring aspects of the 1994 law unconstitutional (Halmai and Scheppele 1997, 172), but I was unable to find a source identifying who brought the petition. The law was ruled to be too vague in its targeting and inadequate in its treatment of the secrecy and freedom of information about individuals (Fithen 2009, 19). In response, the 1996 law narrowed the scope of the policy. Judges and prosecutors were no longer targeted, and the scope of vetting of the public administration and media was narrowed (Barrett et al 2007, 278-80). The 1996 also dealt with ""informational self-determination"" issues by creating a Historical Office to house communist security service files and provide access to affected individuals (Fithen 2009, 19). The 2000 law again expanded the scope of those targeted by the policy for lustration. Those newly targeted by this version were mostly in the media (Barrett et al 2007, 272). This law also renewed targeting of judges and prosecutors (Barrett et al 2007, 279). As of 2004 (when the lustration process expired), almost 9,600 officials had been screened, 126 were singled out for greater scrutiny, 24 resigned, and 15 had their decisions published (Fithen 2009, 19-20). Hungary took an early but a narrow and limited approach to lustration, delimiting the scope of positions to be screened to the president and parliament. While Hungary started lustration early, it was also one of the earliest to formally close the lustration process, thereby truncating the process compared to others in the region.

""The types of cases reviewed included, inter alia, police officers who were guards or interrogators in concentration camps and took part in ill-treatment of prisoners; commanders of military police units that operated detention facilities where atrocities occurred; and officers were directly involved in war crimes or crimes against humanity including murder, rape, torture, and ill-treatment during the conflict""(Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 190). According to the Dayton Peace Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina consisted of two equal entities: The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska (RS) (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 185). In 1998, the restructuring agreement was also signed by the RS, authorizing the UNMIBH to vet police based on a three-step personnel reform process: registration, provisional authorization, and certification (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg, 188). From November 1999 to December 2000, UNMIBH registered all Ministry of the Interior personnel who presented themselves in the registration process, which included information on qualifications, current assignment, professional history and background. The Local Police Registry Section was established by the Human Rights Office of the UNMIBH (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 188). During the provisional authorization, registered people had to undergo an initial screening process to remove those who did not meet the minimum criteria for service (minimum age, citizenship, minimal training requirements, and a position requiring the exercise of police powers). ""Circumstances that precluded provisional authorization were, inter alia, a criminal record or indictment or previous removal by UNMIBH""(Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 189). Those who met the criteria were authorized to exercise police powers and were given an UNMIBH identification card (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 189). Those certified were subjected to even more extensive background checks and performance monitoring. Those who passed received full certification from the UNMIBH, which was decided by the UNMIBH police commissioner (Mayer-Reickh, 2007, pg 189). A police officer who was not certified could no longer exercise police powers (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 190). If someone was denied certification, they could request a review of his or her case, yet there were no specific steps to this process. In 2002, an international UNMIBH panel was created, independent of the UNMIBH police commissioner. This panel reviewed submissions and could refer cases back to the commissioner for reconsideration, who had the final decision (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 190-1). March 2004, over one hundred fifty noncertified police officers asked domestic courts to review their dismissals. Some courts believed that they had no jurisdiction over UNMIBH decisions. Other courts issued judgments declaring such dismissals unlawful and reinstating police officers that were not certified by UNMIBH (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 194). In February 2007, the Human Rights Ministry established a commission to review the dismissals and report to the newly formed government (Stan, Nedelsky, 2013, pg 64). UNMIBH's mandate and the certification law came to a close in December 2002. In the Course of the certification process, UNMIBH registered and screened all 23, 751 Ministry of Interior personnel who presented themselves to the registration teams. This law was full implemented (Mayer-Rieckh, 2007, pg 190).",1996,2002,Other,treaty / intl mission,Yes (fully or partially),,court challenge did not modify the policy,24000,"""Annex 4: Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.""

On November 30, the Assembly adopted Law 8043 on the Verification of the Moral Character of Officials and other Persons Connected with the Defense of the Democratic State (the Verification Law). These laws constitute Albania's 1995 vetting and lustration policies. The genocide law includes language specifically in response to past human rights abuses; after a 1997 amendment, both laws included provisions about crimes against humanity (Ballauri and Imholz 2005, 40). The Genocide Law prohibited persons with ties to the communist regime prior to 31 March 1991 from holding selected positions in the government, parliament, judiciary, or mass media until the year 2002. It applied to former members of the Politburo and Central Committee, ministers, parliamentary deputies, presidents of the Supreme Court, former Secret Police agents and informers. The Verification Law provided for the screening of potential and actual members of the government, police, judiciary, educational system, and media in order to determine affiliations with communist era government organs and/or state police. The law created a seven-member commission, consisting of the chairman, deputy chairman and five members, who were to be honourable citizens in good standing and not Members of Parliament. The Parliament had the right to name and remove the chairman, while the deputy chairman and one member were to be named and removed by the Council of Ministers, and one member each by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior [Public Order], the Ministry of Defence and the National [State] Information Service. The committee was appointed by the government in power and tended to carry out reviews in secret, raising concerns with human-rights NGOs such as Helsinki Watch that the process was vulnerable to political manipulation (Austin and Ellison 2009, 187-189). The law authorized exclusive use of secret police files to screen potential and actual members of the government, police, judiciary, educational system, and media for affiliations with the communist era government and/or state police. Candidates could not run for elected office without clearance from the Commission. The law provided for direct appeal to the Court of Cassation, the highest court in Albania. However, only 57 cases were appealed and 7 overturned. The Commission barred 139 people from participating in the 1996 elections. When the constitutionality of the law was challenged in court in 1996, the Constitutional Court upheld most provisions, invalidating only the provision subjecting journalists from affected positions.",1995,1996,Legislature/Parliament,legislative act,Yes (fully or partially),"was partially implemented, but not that widespread",court challenge modified the policy,,"Austin, Robert C.

55,790,0,,Reintegration of Maoist forces,,"In 2006, the Nepalese government and Maoist rebels agreed to a ceasefire, ending a ten-year civil war. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), signed in November 2006, mandated that a ""Special Committee"" be created to carry out reintegration and rehabilitation of Maoist army personnel, but did not set out conditions by which Maoist fighters would be vetted. In December 2006, a more detailed agreement was signed by both the Nepalese and Maoist leadership in what was apparently an ad hoc process (Acharya 2008). According to the vetting policy, prior to the reintegration of Maoist forces, individuals in the Maoist army would be dismissed if they had joined the army after the date of a May 2006 ceasefire (making them illegal fighters, since they were not party to the ceasefire). Individuals would also be dismissed if they were minors when they joined the Maoist forces-a violation of international law (Yardley 2010). By 2009, approximately 1,000 individuals were dismissed because they joined the Maoist army after the date of the cease-fire. Approximately 3,000 more were dismissed because they had been minors at the time of their recruitment (BBC 2009).

2,700,0,1,Vetting of (national) Parliamentary Candidates & constitutional ban on electoral candidates extended to provincial- and district-level elections,,"Ahead of Afghanistan's 2005 national parliamentary elections, a series of presidential decrees established rules for candidate eligibility. Widespread concern existed that the elections could be undermined by the threat of force by non-state militias or similar groups. Additionally, pressure existed from international NGOs and the Afghan public to exclude human rights violators from public office (Ayub et. al. 2009, 18). While the Constitution of Afghanistan prevents anyone convicted of human rights violations from running for office, the weak state of the Afghan judiciary rendered that exclusion irrelevant. Ultimately, the Afghan government decreed that candidates would be excluded if they had ties to illegal armed groups (IAGs) that had not been dismantled, ""with the understanding that success in this area had some bearing on human rights protection"" (Grossman 2009, 29-30). The Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) examined challenges against the eligibility of individual candidates. These challenges were filed both by organizations and ordinary citizens. In addition to reviewing these challenges, the ECC checked candidates against a list prepared by the Disarmament and Reintegration Commission, which had already been working to dismantle IAGs and thus had relevant data on participation. In practice, ""the majority of the 1,144 challenges...had to do with human rights violations and war crimes."" Alleged crimes covered a timespan from 1978 until the elections, with many complaints stemming from the period of the 1990s when implicated individuals were in political power (Ayub et al. 2009, 34). Approximately 200 candidates were disqualified by the ECC on the basis of ties to IAGs. These individuals were notified and given the opportunity to respond to the exclusion, including the opportunity to be reinstated as candidates after disarming and disbanding their IAGs. This mechanism functioned as a sort of appeals process. Approximately 150 individuals demonstrated compliance with the disarmament request and regained eligibility (Ayub et al. 2009, 24-25). The effectiveness of the vetting process was questioned on several fronts. Most notably, vetting was a closed process that still allowed many individuals with ties to IAGs to participate, either because they were never excluded or because their eligibility was restored on the basis of a promise of future compliance. Moreover, the ECC and other agencies involved lacked adequate resources, and the project was compressed into a short timescale (Ayub et al. 2009, 25-34). The election body charged with verifying candidate eligibility did not participate in the vetting process for the 2009 election, effectively moving the responsibility for candidate vetting to a different election body, which did not have enough time to complete the in-depth interviews required by the vetting process.",2005,2019,Executive,executive decree,Yes (fully or partially),"Individuals were notified and given the opportunity to respond to the exclusion, including the opportunity to be reinstated as candidates after disarming and disbanding their IAGs.

9,346,0,,Dayton Agreement,1995-12-14,"On 14 December 1995, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Republic of Bosnia and Herzgovina, and the Republic of Croatia signed the Dayton Agreement through a treaty process. The Agreement includes several vetting and lustration provisions. First, it bars individuals serving a sentence imposed by the ICTY or under indictment by the ICTY from running for or holding office. A loophole in this ban permits formerly convicted individuals and unindicted individuals suspected of war crimes to run for and hold public office. A report from the International Crisis Group names individuals in eighteen Republika Srpska municipalities and the Brcko District who are alleged to have committed or supervised indictable acts, and are therefore potentially indictable for war crimes under the criteria issued by the ICTY. However, they continue to work in the police force, hold public office, exercise power through the legal and illegal economy, or influence politics Second, the Dayton Agreement requires dismissal or prosecution of police officers and public servants responsible for ""serious violations of minority rights."" In December 1996, the UN Security Council passed UNSCR 1088, establishing United Nations Mission In Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) to conduct investigations of police who had committed abuse. From November 1999-2000, the UNMIBH required all police personnel to register for certification to continue their service. The UNMIHB denied certification to individuals with criminal records, indictments, or previous removal by the UNMIHB. Those denied certification appeal the denial through an unspecified review process. UNMIBH’s mandate and the certification law came to a close in December 2002. In the Course of the certification process, UNMIBH registered and screened all 23, 751 Ministry of Interior personnel who presented themselves to the registration teams. Third, the Dayton Agreement empowered the Office of the High Representative (OHR, the international body that oversaw the implementation of the civilian aspects of the Dayton Agreement) to remove civil servants from public office for reasons ranging from their wartime record to obstructing the implementation of the peace process. These OHR powers, known as the Bonn Powers, were used by successive High Representatives to remove or ban 185 public officials from office, including senior officials and politicians, although some of these individuals were later rehabilitated by the OHR and were allowed to re-enter public life.",1995,1995,Other,treaty / intl mission,Yes (fully or partially),"The vetting process was implemented, but limited due to a significant loophole permitting those formerly convicted of crimes and those not indicted to hold office. In many Republika Srpska municipalities, individuals alleged to have committed violations of international humanitarian law during the 1992-1995 war – mass murder, ethnic cleansing, and mass rape – remain in positions of power. They continue to work in the police force, hold public office, exercise power through the legal and illegal economy, or influence politics from behind the scenes. Although they allegedly committed indictable offenses, such individuals may continue to hold office because they have not been indicted.",no court challenge,24000,"""Annex 4: Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.""

154,235,0,64,Purge of civil servants: Decree Law 123 (11 March 1975),,"After the 1974 transition in Portugal, the provisional government issued a series of decree laws to regulate purges of the civil service occurring without regulation ('wildcat' purges). Decree Law 277 (25 June 1974) established a vetting commission (Inter-ministerial Purge and Reclassification Commission or CIMSR) to coordinate existing purge commissions and create new ones for ministries without them. This law also established criteria for vetting civil servants. This legislation was ""revised several times"" between 1974 and 1976. Decree Law 123 (11 March 1975) introduced new criteria for vetting civil servants (Pinto 2006, pages 181, 183). According to Decree Law 277, criteria for sanction included ""non-democratic behavior in the course of duty after the coup, inability to adapt to the new democratic regime and incompetence"" and, according to criteria set forth ""a little later by the government,"" dismissals were applied to those who had been members of ""the dictatorship's governmental elite; political police collaborators; leading members of either the MP, the LP or the single party; and the heads of the dictatorship's censorship board."" Decree Law 123 added ""individual political behavior before the fall of the authoritarian regime"" (Pinto 2006, 183). The purges coordinated by the CIMSR targeted various civil service sectors (Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc) and dismissed individuals because of their ""political behavior"" during the previous regime (while holding their current position or another position) or because they were members of the ""governmental elite,"" had collaborated with the political police, were leading members of certain parties or served on the censorship board (Pinto 2006, 183-85). Each ministry (Justice, Labor, etc) had its own purge commission, and all the commissions were coordinated by the CIMSR. During 1974-75, regulated and unregulated purges occurred alongside each other. By February In 1976, the CIMSR’s main task was reintegrating those individuals who had been purged illegally (Pinto 2006, 187). Decree Law 471 (14 June 1976) declared previous purges that did not adhere to due process ""null and void"" (Pinto 2006, 192). Between 1976 and 1980, many individuals who had been purged legally and illegally were reintegrated (Pinto 2006, 193). Victims of the purges formed the Movement for the Reintegration of the Unfairly Dismissed in 1976 and engaged in protest activity, but I find no evidence of challenges submitted to a legal body (Pinto 2006, 192). I find no evidence of an appeals process. This policy ended in 1976.",1975,1976,Executive,executive decree,Yes (fully or partially),,don't know,,"Pinto, Antonio Costa.
