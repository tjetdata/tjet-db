Its decisions can be challenged in court .In some cases, the Commission obtained a case number that demonstrated collaboration with the KGB, but the courts deemed such evidence inconclusive. As a result, the Commission has publicized the names of few individuals. Horne (2017) argues that: regarding phase two, the Lustration Commission had tepid political support, lacked resources, and the staff was voluntary and unpaid (Anušauskas 2011). File access issues, data reliability problems, and high information hurdles to legally prove collaboration posed substantial burdens on the resource strapped Commission (Vėgelytė 2009). Moreover, they were tasked with implementing lustration cases against high-profile individuals in positions of power with significant financial resources (Vėgelytė 2009).29 All of this hindered the work of the Commission",court challenge modified the policy,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,2025-12-16

A number of prominent scholars, lawyers, and NGOs took the position that a law is not fair and constitutional, among other things, considering that it targeted a broad group of people without sufficient and immediate nexus to undemocratic practices. In Polyakh and others v. Ukraine (applications nos. 58812/15 and others, Judgment of 17 October 2019), the European Court of Human Rights found that the lustration of several individuals under the law violated those individuals' rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. Namely, the Court found that Ukraine violated the applicants' right to a fair trial within a reasonable time. This was so as the court proceedings based on their complaints lasted for more than four and a half years since the district court waited for the Constitutional Court to decide on whether the lustration measures were constitutional. In turn, the Constitutional Court’s proceedings were unjustifiably delayed. The Court also ruled on the violation of the applicants' right to privacy, considering that the nature and broad scope of lustration measures were disproportionate to the legitimate aim of preserving democracy. The Court mentioned the following factors in this regard: i. The application of the lustration law did not involve any individual assessment of the lustrated persons’ conduct, including their alleged commission of any specific acts to the detriment of democracy, the rule of law, national security, or human rights. ii. The state needed compelling reasons to use such a broad lustration scheme and to explain how merely being a public servant during the Yanukovych government for a certain time could signify a lack of loyalty to democratic principles. iii. The scheme was overbroad and not sufficiently narrowed down to the “pressing social need.” For example, several applicants were lustrated merely because they failed to resign from their posts one year after Yanukovych became the president. In this case, the triggering event of somebody taking office instead of some negative developments connected to individuals was not a justified criterion for dismissing career public servants. iv. The Court noted that the then-President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, who signed the lustration law himself was a minister in the Yanukovych government for less than a year. In the Court’s opinion, that makes it hard to see how the goal of the lustration law could be achieved by removing far less important officials from public services. On a separate note, the Court had doubts about whether the law pursued the declared legitimate aims rather than the desire for retribution. Following the decision of the Court, the Ukrainian Supreme Court issued a decision in favor of a lustrated person (ordering the reinstatement of the person to the previously held position) based on the violation of the Convention with reasoning similar to that of the Court and despite the parallel constitutional review by the Constitutional Court. This decision ignited the spark of other cases ordering the reinstatement of lustrated individuals to their position in the state apparatus.",court challenge did not modify the policy,1,0,1,0,,,0,0,2025-12-16
