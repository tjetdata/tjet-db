Based on command responsibility and accomplice theories. Mandatory forced labor for life. Civil damages: estimated at US$43million. In July 2008, Constant was convicted in Brooklyn, New York, of mortgage fraud and faced up to five to fifteen years in prison, before then being sent back to Haiti to serve a life sentence. The suit filed by CJA was heard in July 25, 2008 and resulted in Constant being sentenced by a federal court in New York to pay $19 million to three women who survived gang rapes and other violence committed by paramilitary forces under Constant's control. Constant was found liable for torture, including rape, attempted extrajudicial killing, and crimes against humanity in connection with his role as the leader of FRAPH. July 25, 2008 convicted by a Brooklyn jury for fraud and grand larceny. October 28, 2008 Kings County Supreme Court sentenced him to 12-37 years in prison. Judge Gerges concluded his memorandum with a plea that the United States government allow Constant to serve his entire sentence in New York State, rather than return him to Haiti ""where he may evade justice due to the instability of the Haitian judicial system."" Judge Gerges noted that ""it is apparent that the federal authorities may deport him shortly."" On 1 December 2009, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judgment for $19 million against Constant. Currently incarcerated in a maximum security prison in New York",2025-11-16

""President Carlos Menem granted a pardon to all of them five years later, in 1990 and thus Videla was released after only a few years in prison.""





""In September 2006, a Federal Judge declared the pardon given to Videla in 1990 by then president Carlos Menem inconstitutional. Videla had the possibility of appealing such decision before the Supreme Court.



On April 2007, the Argentinean justice revoked the amnesty awarded to Videla. The Federal Court deemed it 'unconstitutional' and decided that Videla and Massera (see 'cases related'Ã‚Â) should return to prison to serve their life in prison sentences for crimes against humanity.""



""On 22 December 2010, the Federal Oral Court No. 1 of Cordoba found Videla guilty of the crimes of:



- torture aggravated by the condition of political persecution of the victim (32 counts);

- murder (29 counts);

- torture followed by death (1 count)



and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Videla must serve his sentence in a common jail of the province of Cordoba.""

In the April 1999 retrial on 155 criminal charges the court found Noriega innocent once again, citing insufficient evidence

CONFREGUA appealed the decision

On July 23, 1999 an appellate court annulled the lower court's decision and remanded the case for a third trial in front of a panel of judges from the department of Totonicapan (neighboring department to ensure impartiality)

The new trial began on September 20, 1999: many witnesses, fearing reprisals, refused to testify and so Noriega was retried for less crimes.  These crimes included 11 killings, 7 abductions, rape, breaking and entering, arson and various threats

On November 12 Noriega was found guilty of 6 murders and 2 cases of manslaughter but due to lack of evidence was absolved of the other charges (rape, torture, kidnapping, burning persons alive)



This decision was appealed by Noriega's attorney and an investigation was ongoing by the Public Ministry of Noreiga's supposed accomplice Juan Alesio Samoya and militiary officers who served at Base 20 in Quiche in 1982 (suspected intellectual authors of Noriega's crimes)



On February 15 2000 an appeals court upheld the verdict.  On August 24, 2000 the CSJ rejected a similar appeal and upheld the verdict and sentence.



In 1996 the Penal Code was modified to extend the maximum sentence for murder from 30 to 50 years' imprisonment. Because the case began prior to this change, the commuted death sentence for the two murder convictions is for 30 years.

The May 1982 death in police custody of a Taipei taxi driver, Wang Ying-hsien, focused public attention on the use of physical violence by police in interrogating criminal suspects. Although Wang's death was officially declared a suicide, five policemen were eventually brought to trial and sentenced to terms ranging from 16 months to four and one-half years for illegally arresting Wang and causing him bodily harm. On July 4 the Taiwan High Court upheld the conviction. However, Chao Chun-jung, the highest ranking of the convicted policemen, escaped abroad in September while waiting for the Supreme Court to hear his appeal, and in November the Supreme Court ordered a retrial of the five policemen, none of whom has yet spent any time behind bars.

The case was re-opened in October when experts testified that Lacko had died as a result of being hit by a car driven by a police officer. In December the court sentenced four young men to sentences of 3 years in prison, 1 year in prison, 2 years of probation, and 11/2 years of probation. All four were found to be indirectly responsible for Lacko's death; the one defendant who admitted to attacking the victim was convicted of attempting to cause bodily harm and given the longest sentence (these are all non-government actors)

11 defendants, including Lacan Chaclan, were sentenced to 5 years in prison, commutable for $.65 a day.



The remaining 14 defendants were found guilty of negligent homicide and sentenced to 4 years in prison (also commutable)



The sentences were criticized by human rights groups as being too lenient because they amounted to little more than time served



Observers also noted apparent judicial bias in the trial as well as anomalies, harassment and intimidation of prosecutors, judges, witnesses



The prosecutor appealed the decision because he believed the sentences to be too lenient



Claiming that the verdict was negotiated with the military, the former private plaintiff in the case, the Rigoberta Menchu Foundation, threatened to bring the case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), but had not done so by year's end.



On December 6, 1999, an appellate court in Coban annulled the trial court's verdict, citing ""fundamental errors"", including ""failure to observe, correctly interpret, or correctly apply the law.""

On January 30, 2006 the High Court of Cassation and Justice rejected an appeal

The appeal was based on a new forensic report attributing Ursu's death to a lack of medical care and not to the beating itself, thereby contradicting the original 1993 forensic report.



On August 9, 2006 the High Court for Cassation and Justice rejected an appeal filed by Ursu's family against the authorities' decision to release Stanica from prison on medical grounds in April 2005. The other convict remained in prison.

""Shortly after taking power in March, Rajoelina's de facto government authorized the release and pardon of 48 individuals it deemed ""political prisoners,"" who were imprisoned under the Ravalomanana government. Twenty of these prisoners had not yet received an official pardon, and remained in a poorly enforced house arrest. These includes a number of nonpolitical criminals, guilty of murder and other grave human rights violations during past conflicts. Most prominent among them was Lieutenant Colonel Assolant Coutiti""



""Following widespread condemnation of the release, Rajoelina's government did not release any further prisoners whose incarceration predates the current political crisis. Several opposition figures arrested during the year were released in August as a gesture of good faith in advance of implementation of the Charter of the Transition. The release was criticized, however, for requiring them to sign a letter promising not to engage in further political activities.""",2025-11-16

that were outside the scope of the case and that the proceedings in relation to these acts must be discontinued. 

The Appeals Chamber
also found that Mr Bemba cannot be held criminally liable under article 28 of the ICC Rome Statute for the remaining crimes committed by MLC troops during the Central African Republic operation and that he must be acquitted thereof because the Trial Chamber had
made serious errors in its finding that Mr Bemba had failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or repress the
crimes of the MLC troops.

Therefore, the Appeals Chamber, by majority, considered it was appropriate to reverse his conviction and enter an acquittal.

The Appeals Chamber also dismissed as moot the appeals that Mr Bemba and the Prosecutor had brought against the sentence Trial Chamber III had imposed",2025-11-16
