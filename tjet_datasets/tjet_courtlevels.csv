Family members also brought the case to the IACHR. The Government was seeking to negotiate a settlement with the plaintiffs. (1996 SD report

The criminal case against the PAC members remained before the courts in 1997 because it was remanded for a retrial by an appellate court (1997 SD report)

12 PAC members were convicted in 1998

They were originally sentenced to 10- 14 years in January 1998 but a judge increased the sentences to 25 years in July 1998 following an appeal by the defendants.

The PAC members escaped/released in 1999 and no further information on their recapture is available. “There was no apparent progress in recapturing 12 former PAC members convicted in 1999 for the 1993 killing of Juan Chanay Pablo in Colotenango, Huehuetenango, and then freed in April 1999 from a police station by a crowd armed with sticks, machetes, homemade explosives, and smoke bombs. Although arrest warrants were issued to recapture the escapees, they remained at large despite credible reports that they had returned to their home region of Colotenango and were being protected by former PAC comrades.”



In April 1999 a mob of over 400 people stormed the jail and freed the 12 ex-paramilitaries



On April 29, 1999 a criminal court confirmed the convictions and sentences for the 12 PAC members

Coutiti was sentenced to 5 years in prison on June 9, 2003 and previously sentenced to a five year, 10 year, three year and 10 year jail terms for charges relating to the same crisis

Coutiti was again convicted in 2004 on two counts of torture

He was released under Rajoelina's de facto government in 2009:

""Shortly after taking power in March, Rajoelina's de facto government authorized the release and pardon of 48 individuals it deemed ""political prisoners,"" who were imprisoned under the Ravalomanana government. Twenty of these prisoners had not yet received an official pardon, and remained in a poorly enforced house arrest. These includes a number of nonpolitical criminals, guilty of murder and other grave human rights violations during past conflicts. Most prominent among them was Lieutenant Colonel Assolant Coutiti""

""Following widespread condemnation of the release, Rajoelina's government did not release any further prisoners whose incarceration predates the current political crisis. Several opposition figures arrested during the year were released in August as a gesture of good faith in advance of implementation of the Charter of the Transition. The release was criticized, however, for requiring them to sign a letter promising not to engage in further political activities.""",2024-11-26

""President Carlos Menem granted a pardon to all of them five years later, in 1990 and thus Videla was released after only a few years in prison.""





""In September 2006, a Federal Judge declared the pardon given to Videla in 1990 by then president Carlos Menem inconstitutional. Videla had the possibility of appealing such decision before the Supreme Court.



On April 2007, the Argentinean justice revoked the amnesty awarded to Videla. The Federal Court deemed it 'unconstitutional' and decided that Videla and Massera (see 'cases related'Ã‚Â) should return to prison to serve their life in prison sentences for crimes against humanity.""



""On 22 December 2010, the Federal Oral Court No. 1 of Cordoba found Videla guilty of the crimes of:



- torture aggravated by the condition of political persecution of the victim (32 counts);

- murder (29 counts);

- torture followed by death (1 count)



and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Videla must serve his sentence in a common jail of the province of Cordoba.""

In the April 1999 retrial on 155 criminal charges the court found Noriega innocent once again, citing insufficient evidence

CONFREGUA appealed the decision

On July 23, 1999 an appellate court annulled the lower court's decision and remanded the case for a third trial in front of a panel of judges from the department of Totonicapan (neighboring department to ensure impartiality)

The new trial began on September 20, 1999: many witnesses, fearing reprisals, refused to testify and so Noriega was retried for less crimes.  These crimes included 11 killings, 7 abductions, rape, breaking and entering, arson and various threats



On November 12 Noriega was found guilty of 6 murders and 2 cases of manslaughter but due to lack of evidence was absolved of the other charges (rape, torture, kidnapping, burning persons alive)



This decision was appealed by Noriega's attorney and an investigation was ongoing by the Public Ministry of Noreiga's supposed accomplice Juan Alesio Samoya and militiary officers who served at Base 20 in Quiche in 1982 (suspected intellectual authors of Noriega's crimes)



On February 15 2000 an appeals court upheld the verdict.  On August 24, 2000 the CSJ rejected a similar appeal and upheld the verdict and sentence.



In 1996 the Penal Code was modified to extend the maximum sentence for murder from 30 to 50 years' imprisonment. Because the case began prior to this change, the commuted death sentence for the two murder convictions is for 30 years.

Rashid al Tikriti and Ahmed al-Juburi were executed on September 8, 2007



""At the end of November 2007, the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki formally asked US President George Bush to hand over the [remaining] three convicted defendants immediately.

Earlier the same month, US commanders had said they would not transfer the men to Iraqi custody until they received an ""authoritative"" request from the Iraqi government.



On 28 February 2008, the three-member Iraqi presidential council agreed to al-Majid's execution, but did not approve death sentences against the other two -- Hussein Rashid Mohammed, and Sultan Hashim al-Tai.""

On January 30, 2006 the High Court of Cassation and Justice rejected an appeal

The appeal was based on a new forensic report attributing Ursu's death to a lack of medical care and not to the beating itself, thereby contradicting the original 1993 forensic report.



On August 9, 2006 the High Court for Cassation and Justice rejected an appeal filed by Ursu's family against the authorities' decision to release Stanica from prison on medical grounds in April 2005. The other convict remained in prison.

1250,1117,Lower,,29,April,1999,1999-04-29,1,Guilty Upheld,1,25 years,20+ years,Ordinary prison,"9 Colotenango PAC  defendants were originally acquitted due to lack of evidence on April 11, 1996 and the decision was appealed by the Public Ministry.  Family members also brought the case to the IACHR. The Government was seeking to negotiate a settlement with the plaintiffs. (1996 SD report

The criminal case against the PAC members remained before the courts in 1997 because it was remanded for a retrial by an appellate court (1997 SD report)

12 PAC members were convicted in 1998

They were originally sentenced to 10- 14 years in January 1998 but a judge increased the sentences to 25 years in July 1998 following an appeal by the defendants.

The PAC members escaped/released in 1999 and no further information on their recapture is available. “There was no apparent progress in recapturing 12 former PAC members convicted in 1999 for the 1993 killing of Juan Chanay Pablo in Colotenango, Huehuetenango, and then freed in April 1999 from a police station by a crowd armed with sticks, machetes, homemade explosives, and smoke bombs. Although arrest warrants were issued to recapture the escapees, they remained at large despite credible reports that they had returned to their home region of Colotenango and were being protected by former PAC comrades.”



In April 1999 a mob of over 400 people stormed the jail and freed the 12 ex-paramilitaries



On April 29, 1999 a criminal court confirmed the convictions and sentences for the 12 PAC members

April 1994, the first appeals court decreed that the 1993 convictions were null for procedural faults and a lack of evidence against Castillo.

The original court reviewed the case and ratified its original decision, which was then upheld by the appeals court.

October 1996, the first appeals court dismissed the sentences and ordered the second criminal court to issue new sentences

February 1997, the second criminal court found Castillo innocent

June 1998, Supreme Court confirmed this, but the victim's lawyers filed a final appeal, upon which the June 1999 decision was based.

The Court ordered the gathering of the official certification of the accused.

In February 2011 (2.1.2011) the Court emitted the final ruling (sentenza). The Court formally acknowledges the death of the accused on 11.8.2010. The court argues that given the information presented and studied in the hearings, it is impossible to declare the accused free of charges (the impossibility of a sentenza di assoluzione). The evidence points to the confirmation of the guilt of the accused as one of the principal creators of the repressive scheme of the military regime in Argentina, but also one of the principal executives of such a scheme at the ESMA, where the victims were kept, tortured and killed.

The charges  are declared extinct  given the death of the accused (art. 531 c.p.p.)",2024-11-26

that were outside the scope of the case and that the proceedings in relation to these acts must be discontinued. The Appeals Chamber
also found that Mr Bemba cannot be held criminally liable under article 28 of the ICC Rome Statute for the remaining crimes committed
by MLC troops during the Central African Republic operation and that he must be acquitted thereof because the Trial Chamber had
made serious errors in its finding that Mr Bemba had failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or repress the
crimes of the MLC troops.
Therefore, the Appeals Chamber, by majority, considered it was appropriate to reverse his conviction and enter an acquittal.
The Appeals Chamber also dismissed as moot the appeals that Mr Bemba and the Prosecutor had brought against the sentence Trial
Chamber III had imposed",2024-11-26

April 1994, the first appeals court decreed that the 1993 convictions were null for procedural faults and a lack of evidence against Castillo.

The original court reviewed the case and ratified its original decision, which was then upheld by the appeals court.

October 1996, the first appeals court dismissed the sentences and ordered the second criminal court to issue new sentences

February 1997, the second criminal court found Castillo innocent

June 1998, Supreme Court confirmed this, but the victim's lawyers filed a final appeal, upon which the June 1999 decision was based.

Rashid al Tikriti and Ahmed al-Juburi were executed on September 8, 2007



""At the end of November 2007, the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki formally asked US President George Bush to hand over the [remaining] three convicted defendants immediately.

Earlier the same month, US commanders had said they would not transfer the men to Iraqi custody until they received an ""authoritative"" request from the Iraqi government.



On 28 February 2008, the three-member Iraqi presidential council agreed to al-Majid's execution, but did not approve death sentences against the other two -- Hussein Rashid Mohammed, and Sultan Hashim al-Tai.""

Based on command responsibility and accomplice theories. Mandatory forced labor for life. Civil damages: estimated at US$43million. In July 2008, Constant was convicted in Brooklyn, New York, of mortgage fraud and faced up to five to fifteen years in prison, before then being sent back to Haiti to serve a life sentence. The suit filed by CJA was heard in July 25, 2008 and resulted in Constant being sentenced by a federal court in New York to pay $19 million to three women who survived gang rapes and other violence committed by paramilitary forces under Constant's control. Constant was found liable for torture, including rape, attempted extrajudicial killing, and crimes against humanity in connection with his role as the leader of FRAPH. July 25, 2008 convicted by a Brooklyn jury for fraud and grand larceny. October 28, 2008 Kings County Supreme Court sentenced him to 12-37 years in prison. Judge Gerges concluded his memorandum with a plea that the United States government allow Constant to serve his entire sentence in New York State, rather than return him to Haiti ""where he may evade justice due to the instability of the Haitian judicial system."" Judge Gerges noted that ""it is apparent that the federal authorities may deport him shortly."" On 1 December 2009, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judgment for $19 million against Constant. Currently incarcerated in a maximum security prison in New York",2024-11-26

Coutiti was sentenced to 5 years in prison on June 9, 2003 and previously sentenced to a five year, 10 year, three year and 10 year jail terms for charges relating to the same crisis

Coutiti was again convicted in 2004 on two counts of torture

He was released under Rajoelina's de facto government in 2009:

""Shortly after taking power in March, Rajoelina's de facto government authorized the release and pardon of 48 individuals it deemed ""political prisoners,"" who were imprisoned under the Ravalomanana government. Twenty of these prisoners had not yet received an official pardon, and remained in a poorly enforced house arrest. These includes a number of nonpolitical criminals, guilty of murder and other grave human rights violations during past conflicts. Most prominent among them was Lieutenant Colonel Assolant Coutiti""

""Following widespread condemnation of the release, Rajoelina's government did not release any further prisoners whose incarceration predates the current political crisis. Several opposition figures arrested during the year were released in August as a gesture of good faith in advance of implementation of the Charter of the Transition. The release was criticized, however, for requiring them to sign a letter promising not to engage in further political activities.""",2024-11-26

The sentences were criticized by human rights groups as being too lenient because they amounted to little more than time served

The May 1982 death in police custody of a Taipei taxi driver, Wang Ying-hsien, focused public attention on the use of physical violence by police in interrogating criminal suspects. Although Wang's death was officially declared a suicide, five policemen were eventually brought to trial and sentenced to terms ranging from 16 months to four and one-half years for illegally arresting Wang and causing him bodily harm. On July 4 the Taiwan High Court upheld the conviction. However, Chao Chun-jung, the highest ranking of the convicted policemen, escaped abroad in September while waiting for the Supreme Court to hear his appeal, and in November the Supreme Court ordered a retrial of the five policemen, none of whom has yet spent any time behind bars.

11 defendants, including Lacan Chaclan, were sentenced to 5 years in prison, commutable for $.65 a day.



The remaining 14 defendants were found guilty of negligent homicide and sentenced to 4 years in prison (also commutable)



The sentences were criticized by human rights groups as being too lenient because they amounted to little more than time served



Observers also noted apparent judicial bias in the trial as well as anomalies, harassment and intimidation of prosecutors, judges, witnesses



The prosecutor appealed the decision because he believed the sentences to be too lenient



Claiming that the verdict was negotiated with the military, the former private plaintiff in the case, the Rigoberta Menchu Foundation, threatened to bring the case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), but had not done so by year's end.



On December 6, 1999, an appellate court in Coban annulled the trial court's verdict, citing ""fundamental errors"", including ""failure to observe, correctly interpret, or correctly apply the law."" The court found 15 of the 25 members innocent, including Lacan Chaclan, and released them. The court resentenced the remaining 10 soldiers to 12-year sentences for homicide and causing other nonlethal injuries. (1999 SD Report)



On April 28, 2000 the Supreme Court of Justice annulled the appellate court's verdict after the prosecutor once again appealed the sentences for being too lenient.  The Supreme Court remanded the case back to the trial court and the case was continually delayed by appeals in its retrial.



The original trial was the longest in the country's history and was marked by numerous death threats and acts of intimidation against judges, prosecutors, witnesses, and family members of the victims.(2000 SD report)



On January 16, 2001 the Constitutional Court denied the motions to suspend the case by the defense attorneys for 15 of the suspects.A trial date was set for July 3, but additional dilatory measures by the defense blocked the trial. In July the trial again was suspended pending the resolution of three appeals from defense attorneys to the Constitutional Court. (2001 SD report)



On June 3 2003 the regional sentencing court in San Pedro Carcha, Alta Verapaz reopened the case.  The new trial charged 16 soldiers with murder and a verdict was pending at the end of the year.



On July 9, 2004 an officer and 13 soldiers were each sentenced to 40 years in prison. Defense attorneys stated their intention of once again appealing the sentence.

The Associated Press, July 9, 2004, Friday, BC cycle, International News, 171 words



the case was appealed again, but the Supreme Court confirmed the July 2004 ruling convicting the 14 defendants

Appeal Revised Sentence:

In respect of Gbao, taking into account the Grounds of Appeal which have been allowed, the particular circumstances of this case as well as the form and degree of the participation of Gbao in the crimes, and the seriousness of the crimes, the Appeals Chamber finds that the effective sentence imposed by the Trial Chamber reflects the totality of Gbao's culpable conduct for the crimes under Counts 1, 3 through 11 and 13. The Appeals Chamber, Justices Winter and Fisher dissenting, therefore imposes a global sentence for Counts 1, 3 through 11 and 13 of twenty-five (25) years imprisonment. Taking into account that Gbao Ground 16 has been allowed, in part, the sentence of twenty-five (25) years imprisonment under Count 15 is decreased to twenty (20) years imprisonment;


ORDERS that the sentences shall run concurrently;


ORDERS that Augustine Gbao shall serve a TOTAL TERM OF IMPRISONMENT OF TWENTY-FIVE (25) YEARS, subject to credit being given under Rule 101(D) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence for the period for which he has already been in detention;",2024-11-26

Garcia Meza and his interior minister, Luis Arce Gomez, were found guilty of the murder of socialist leader Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz, trade unionist Gualberto Vega, and congressman Carlos Flores Bedregal during the coup which brought Garcia Meza to power on July 17, 1980. In addition, Garcia Meza, Arce Gomez and twelve paramilitary agents including Montano, Benavidez, and Garcia were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment on a charge of genocide for the killing of eight left-wing leaders in La Paz on January 15, 1981 (HRW 1993).

 ""He has reportedly been living in considerable comfort whilst in prison, with luxuries such as a barbecue, a gym, telephone, a sauna and the occupation of three cells, privileges which have been revoked in response to protests from human rights organizations and victims.""  The minister of the interior (Luis Arce) convicted alongside Garcia Meza was extradited to the US to stand charges for drug trafficking.Here is the information from Trial Watch: Both the MIR and the PS-1 initiated criminal charges against Gomez Arce and Garcia Meza.",2024-11-26

Coutiti was sentenced to 5 years in prison on June 9, 2003 and previously sentenced to a five year, 10 year, three year and 10 year jail terms for charges relating to the same crisis



Coutiti was again convicted in 2004 on two counts of torture



He was released under Rajoelina's de facto government in 2009:



""Shortly after taking power in March, Rajoelina's de facto government authorized the release and pardon of 48 individuals it deemed ""political prisoners,"" who were imprisoned under the Ravalomanana government. Twenty of these prisoners had not yet received an official pardon, and remained in a poorly enforced house arrest. These includes a number of nonpolitical criminals, guilty of murder and other grave human rights violations during past conflicts. Most prominent among them was Lieutenant Colonel Assolant Coutiti""



""Following widespread condemnation of the release, Rajoelina's government did not release any further prisoners whose incarceration predates the current political crisis. Several opposition figures arrested during the year were released in August as a gesture of good faith in advance of implementation of the Charter of the Transition. The release was criticized, however, for requiring them to sign a letter promising not to engage in further political activities.""",2024-11-26

The case was re-opened in October when experts testified that Lacko had died as a result of being hit by a car driven by a police officer. In December the court sentenced four young men to sentences of 3 years in prison, 1 year in prison, 2 years of probation, and 11/2 years of probation. All four were found to be indirectly responsible for Lacko's death; the one defendant who admitted to attacking the victim was convicted of attempting to cause bodily harm and given the longest sentence (these are all non-government actors)

11 defendants, including Lacan Chaclan, were sentenced to 5 years in prison, commutable for $.65 a day.

The remaining 14 defendants were found guilty of negligent homicide and sentenced to 4 years in prison (also commutable)

The sentences were criticized by human rights groups as being too lenient because they amounted to little more than time served

Observers also noted apparent judicial bias in the trial as well as anomalies, harassment and intimidation of prosecutors, judges, witnesses

The prosecutor appealed the decision because he believed the sentences to be too lenient

Claiming that the verdict was negotiated with the military, the former private plaintiff in the case, the Rigoberta Menchu Foundation, threatened to bring the case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), but had not done so by year's end.

On December 6, 1999, an appellate court in Coban annulled the trial court's verdict, citing ""fundamental errors"", including ""failure to observe, correctly interpret, or correctly apply the law."" The court found 15 of the 25 members innocent, including Lacan Chaclan, and released them. The court resentenced the remaining 10 soldiers to 12-year sentences for homicide and causing other nonlethal injuries. (1999 SD Report)

On April 28, 2000 the Supreme Court of Justice annulled the appellate court's verdict after the prosecutor once again appealed the sentences for being too lenient.  The Supreme Court remanded the case back to the trial court and the case was continually delayed by appeals in its retrial.

The original trial was the longest in the country's history and was marked by numerous death threats and acts of intimidation against judges, prosecutors, witnesses, and family members of the victims.(2000 SD report)

On January 16, 2001 the Constitutional Court denied the motions to suspend the case by the defense attorneys for 15 of the suspects.A trial date was set for July 3, but additional dilatory measures by the defense blocked the trial. In July the trial again was suspended pending the resolution of three appeals from defense attorneys to the Constitutional Court. (2001 SD report)

On June 3 2003 the regional sentencing court in San Pedro Carcha, Alta Verapaz reopened the case.  The new trial charged 16 soldiers with murder and a verdict was pending at the end of the year.

On July 9, 2004 an officer and 13 soldiers were each sentenced to 40 years in prison. Defense attorneys stated their intention of once again appealing the sentence.

The Associated Press, July 9, 2004, Friday, BC cycle, International News, 171 words

his appeal was automatically rejected because he had fled the country



In April 2000, Papon filed an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights



In April 2001 the ECHR rejected the appeal



In 2002 he again appealed his sentence under a law passed in April that frees mortally ill prisoners who do not pose a threat to public order and on September 18 the Court of Appeals of Paris ruled that since he was elderly and infirm he should be released on grounds of ill health and he was freed later that day



The Minister of Justice, the Prime Minister and civic groups publicly condemned that decision.  The Government appealed the decision and the case remained pending

On January 30, 2006 the High Court of Cassation and Justice rejected an appeal

On August 9, 2006 the High Court for Cassation and Justice rejected an appeal filed by Ursu's family against the authorities' decision to release Stanica from prison on medical grounds in April 2005. The other convict remained in prison.",2024-11-26

11 defendants, including Lacan Chaclan, were sentenced to 5 years in prison, commutable for $.65 a day.



The remaining 14 defendants were found guilty of negligent homicide and sentenced to 4 years in prison (also commutable)



The sentences were criticized by human rights groups as being too lenient because they amounted to little more than time served



Observers also noted apparent judicial bias in the trial as well as anomalies, harassment and intimidation of prosecutors, judges, witnesses



The prosecutor appealed the decision because he believed the sentences to be too lenient



Claiming that the verdict was negotiated with the military, the former private plaintiff in the case, the Rigoberta Menchu Foundation, threatened to bring the case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), but had not done so by year's end.



On December 6, 1999, an appellate court in Coban annulled the trial court's verdict, citing ""fundamental errors"", including ""failure to observe, correctly interpret, or correctly apply the law."" The court found 15 of the 25 members innocent, including Lacan Chaclan, and released them. The court resentenced the remaining 10 soldiers to 12-year sentences for homicide and causing other nonlethal injuries. (1999 SD Report)



On April 28, 2000 the Supreme Court of Justice annulled the appellate court's verdict after the prosecutor once again appealed the sentences for being too lenient.  The Supreme Court remanded the case back to the trial court and the case was continually delayed by appeals in its retrial.



The original trial was the longest in the country's history and was marked by numerous death threats and acts of intimidation against judges, prosecutors, witnesses, and family members of the victims.(2000 SD report)



On January 16, 2001 the Constitutional Court denied the motions to suspend the case by the defense attorneys for 15 of the suspects.A trial date was set for July 3, but additional dilatory measures by the defense blocked the trial. In July the trial again was suspended pending the resolution of three appeals from defense attorneys to the Constitutional Court. (2001 SD report)



On June 3 2003 the regional sentencing court in San Pedro Carcha, Alta Verapaz reopened the case.  The new trial charged 16 soldiers with murder and a verdict was pending at the end of the year.



On July 9, 2004 an officer and 13 soldiers were each sentenced to 40 years in prison. Defense attorneys stated their intention of once again appealing the sentence.

The Associated Press, July 9, 2004, Friday, BC cycle, International News, 171 words



the case was appealed again, but the Supreme Court confirmed the July 2004 ruling convicting the 14 defendants
