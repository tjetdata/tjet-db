The removal must have been for a continuous period of 12 months or more and the child must not have been in the care of an Aboriginal family during that period” (“Tasmania Shows Leadership on Stolen Generations,” humanrights.gov.au).

80,437,National Commission for Reconciliation and Compensation for Victims,National Commission for Reconciliation and Compensation for Victims (CONARIV),1990-2011,"The National Commission for Reconciliation and Compensation for Victims (CONARIV) was the successor to the reparations policy of the Commission for Dialogue, Truth, and Reconciliation (CDVR). Some information in this form is taken from the CDVR final report’s section on reparations, and some is taken from information released about CONARIV. The law that created CONARIV, ordonnance 2015-174, is not available online. Because of this, the answers to many of the questions in the “policy” and “implementation” sections are unknown. CONARIV was created on March 24, 2015. It compiled a list of 316,954 victims to compensate for violations that occurred between 1990-2011 during various civil wars and post-election violence (see https://www.ictj.org/location/costa-de-marfil). Human Rights Watch reports that about 4,500 victims were compensated by CONARIV's implementation partner, the National Program for Social Cohesion (PNCS), in an initial round of reparations in 2015. It is unclear whether CONARIV and PNCS compensated any other victims, though I found no verifiable reports. On July 3, 2017, CONARIV passed responsibility for the policy to the Ministry of Women, Child Protection, and Solidarity. From Bridget Marchesi: The CONARIV's goal is to complete the work of its predecessor, the Commission for Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation (CDVR), and respond to the government's desire to provide reparations to the victims. The CONARIV's main missions are to identify and make an inventory of the remaining victims who are entitled to reparations and then compensate them based on a single, consolidated data base. There’s also another mission, which was not mentioned in the law under which we were established, and that is reconciliation. After national consultations, the CDVR decided to consider the victims of violence between the period from 1990 to 2011.

Article 39 tasks the TDC with developing “a comprehensive individual and collective program for reparations for victims of violations.” The violations covered are expansive: any State violation between 1955 (when the French colonizers left) and 2013 (when the TDC was established) is potentially eligible for reparations. The definition of “victim” is extremely broad: “any individual, group or legal entity having suffered harm as a result of a violation” (Organic Law 53). The TDC final report, released in May 2019, contains a detailed individual reparations policy. It also contains detailed policy recommendations to the State in lieu of a collective reparations policy (see more below). The TDC aimed to provide material and moral reparation to individuals. Within individual reparations, there are 4 categories of financial compensation. Category 1 compensates for violations of victims’ right to life, including death, death under torture or resulting from torture, and forced disappearances. Category 1 has the highest compensation rates (100%=2,000 Tunisian Dinars). Category 2 compensates for violations of physical or psychological integrity, including “rape, torture, injuries during protests that led to a permanent partial disability, sexual violence, and forms of inhuman, degrading or harsh treatment and punishments” (TDC report, 424). These victims receive different levels of compensation: rape (70%), torture and injury (60%), sexual violence (35%), inhuman treatment (25%). Category 3 compensates for violations affecting the right to liberty and security of person, including prosecution, deprivation from resources, and arbitrary surveillance. These victims receive 40% compensation. Category 3 also includes illegal or arbitrary arrests, which are compensated depending on the amount of time spent in prison. Category 4 compensates violations of civil, political, economic, and social rights, including violation of the right to freedom of worship and right to education. Victims receive 15% compensation. In the case of a deceased victim, “spouses, children, fathers and mothers of victims will benefit from compensations in varying proportions, taking into consideration the specific situation of women, children and those with special needs” (TDC report, 426). Women and children who are relatives of a deceased victim will receive 5% more in compensation than male relatives (see p 427 for percentages). Individual reparations also include rehabilitation (free medical care in public health institutions) and restitution (restoring individuals who lost their jobs to their former, or comparable, employment). Collective reparations suggested in the TDC report aimed to address the root causes of the violations. The TDC recommends over 100 policy recommendations to protect rights to life, liberty, safety; ensure freedom from torture and sexual violence; achieve justice through fair trials; restore civil and political rights; ensure freedom of movement and residence; protect the right to freedom of assembly; improve access to affordable healthcare and education; improve access to jobs; protect minority rights; and fight against racial discrimination. A unique form of collective reparation is reparation for what the TDC calls victim regions, those which have been marginalized and excluded by the State. The TDC makes about 70 recommendations for improving the economic, social, cultural, and environmental development of these victim regions, among other things. On July 25, 2021, President Kais Saied seized power in Tunisia, suspended the Parliament, and began to govern by decree. He dismissed the head of the Dignity and Rehabilitation Fund for the Victims of Totalitarianism, which was tasked with delivering reparations to victims.",no,,2019,,,,,,chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://reparations.qub.ac.uk/assets/uploads/TDC_executive_summary_report.pdf,1,1,1,0,0,0,,,yes,"Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee, part of the Truth and Dignity Commission",yes,,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,no,,,no,yes,yes,yes,don't know,no,unknown,no,,,,0,Loi organique relative à l'instauration et à l'organisation de la justice transitionnelle ; Programme de réparation globale de l'Instance Vérité et Dignité de la Tunisie.,,"compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage); restitution (UNGA: ""restore the victim to the original situation before the gross violations of international human rights law or serious violations of international humanitarian law occurred""); rehabilitation (UNGA: ""medical and pyschological care as well as legal and social services"")",other; rape,,state government,non-recurrence / non-repetition; reconciliation; compensation,geographic-based group (group of individuals with the same relation to a location),"symbolic (memorials, apologies, museums, etc)",domestic law; truth commission,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations); mental/emotional (psychological or mental health challenge or condition resulting from violations); fundamental rights (loss of rights like citizenship, freedom of religion or expression, etc. resulting from violations); economic (loss of income, job/employment, assets, or property resulting from violations)",legislative act,relatives of victims; victims,policy available in multiple languages,Tunisia,2025-01-07
79,452,Reparation and Rehabilitation Fund (created by National Reconciliation Commission),Reparation and Rehabilitation Fund (created by National Reconciliation Commission),"May 6, 1957-January 6, 1993","[copied from Bridget Marchesi's description] Brief Description In October 2006, the administration of Ghanaian President John Kufuor began paying reparations to about 2,000 Ghanaians who had suffered human rights abuses under former governments. Individual one-off payments, which began on October 13, 2006, range from about US $217 to US $3,300 depending on the extent of abuse or violation. The US $1.5 million in payments were recommended by the National Reconciliation Commission (NRC) - formed in 2002 to investigate human rights violations committed under various governments since Ghana gained independence from Britain in 1957 (IRIN 2006). Policy Details Since gaining independence in 1957, Ghana experienced four coups and successive military regimes. Human rights violations such as arbitrary imprisonment, confiscation of property, disappearances, executions and torture, occurred under each of the military governments and intensified following the two coups initiated by former President J. J. Rawlings in 1979 and 1982 (IRIN 2006; Valji 2006). In its Final Report of 2004, the NRC urged the establishment of a comprehensive reparations policy. With regards to monetary compensation, the Report proposed amounts to be paid out to victims based on the types of violations suffered (Valji 2006). In an annex, ""the NRC provided an exhaustive list of 2,514 victims that it considered being eligible for reparations. 2,177 of them were to receive monetary compensation while the others restitution of their employment or of their property. For each individual, the NRC indicated the appropriate reparations measure (but not the violation) and, if applicable, the amount of compensation, reaching from USD $36 to 1,938 or 1-30m GHC"" (Ghana Cedi) (ETJN 2011, 10). Implementation The NRC recommended that compensation be paid to more than 2,500 people who suffered various abuses. The monetary payments total ¢12.2 billion. Money for the payment was released by the government in October 2006. A member of the NRC Implementation said that even though, as many as 4,000 people petitioned the NRC and were heard, only 2,514 people will be compensated: 2,117 will be given monetary compensation while the rest would be reinstated or have their property deconfiscated. Individual one-off payments, which began on October 13, range from about US $217 to US $3,300 depending on the extent of abuse or violation (ETJN 2011). The policy has been partially implemented. A total of 1,268 victims of human rights abuses have been paid close to ¢8 billion (Ghanaian Cedi) in reparation sums as recommended by the NRC by June 2007.

The Charter also establishes a widespread amnesty for security forces and armed Islamist groups who hand over their weapons. The Charter incorporates Executive Decree 97-49 of 12 February 1997 and Executive Decree 99-47 of 13 February 1999, which order compensation for victims and beneficiaries of those harmed in accidents in the anti-terrorist struggle, as well as victims of human rights abuses committed by armed groups. The Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation was approved in a public referendum with 98% approval in September 2005. Presidential Decree 05-278 and Ordinance No 06-02 passed by the Algerian cabinet on February 27, 2006 granted the implementation of the charter. The Charter was established by the President Abdelaziz Bouteflika as a way to bring about a lasting peace between the government and rebel forces. The aim of the Charter was to compensate for the families of victims that suffered disappearances or extrajudicial killings. Also, the Charter introduced compensation measures for economically poor families of persons who were alleged terrorists. In order for relatives of disappeared victims to be eligible for compensation they must obtain a certificate that their relative is missing from the judicial police. After receiving this certificate, they must obtain a death certificate through an administrative ruling within two months of having received the certificate. Relatives of those who were implicated in terrorist acts (and killed) could receive compensation via a judicial police certificate that confirms their relative died as a member of an armed group. However, they must also obtain a certificate from the local wali that demonstrates that they are a materially poor. Families must obtain a certificate that their relative is missing within one year of the implementation of the Charter (February 2006). They must then claim compensation within six months in order to be eligible. Children of victims who are older than 19 and are currently studying are not eligible for compensation, under the assumption that they are financially autonomous. Some of the claims for compensation have been implemented, although certain victims claim that money they were awarded was never disbursed. According to the Chair of the unit in charge of implementing the charter, as of 2011, 6,541 disappeared persons have been recorded, with 6,400 families receiving compensation for their disappearances. According to the ICTJ, at least 7,000 people were disappeared, with more than 150,000 people killed during the decade long conflict.

96,345,Law on Civilian Invalids of War,(Serbia and Montenegro) Law on Civilian Invalids of War,Unspecified in the law,"Bridget’s description: “Legislation of the Republic of Serbia provides compensation to a narrow group of people: war invalids and families of those who were killed in armed conflict or died as a result of being wounded. This compensation is generally reserved for those who fought a war and their families, not civilians who suffered violence and human rights abuses. However, there are two categories of war invalids: military invalids and civilian invalids. The specifics of the reparations policy outlined here refer only to what is relevant to civilian invalids (Humanitarian Law Center, 2007). A civilian war invalid is specifically defined as a civilian ""whose degree of bodily damage sustained as a result of a wound, injury or trauma is at least 50 percent."" The Ministry for Social Affairs interprets the law such that only those injuries suffered on Serbia, no other territory of the former Yugoslavia, are eligible for reparations. Families of civilians who died as a result of wounds or injuries sustained due to the war have a right to monthly compensation only if their income is below a level established in Serbian law. In 2007, there was no official number of those killed or families who received or were entitled to compensation. Additionally, families of those who are missing have the possibility of obtaining monthly compensation; however, they must declare the missing person dead and few actually know about this program (HLC, 2007, 49). Compensation varies according to injury sustained. First-category invalids (suffered gravest harm) receive compensation equivalent to an average salary in Serbia, augmented by 80 percent. It is also possible to receive additional compensation, such as care and assistance benefits, orthopedic implements, supplement, and monthly unemployment benefit. Lesser categories of injuries receive a smaller amount of compensation depending on the gravity of their injury (HLC, 2007). For low-income families of civilians who were killed compensation amounted 14, 750 dinars (187 euros), far less than was paid to families of veterans. As of late 2007, 1,972 people received monetary compensation and other benefits based on their status as civilian war invalid (HLC, 2007). Given the limited nature of the reparations program others have sought compensation in court proceedings against the Republic of Serbia (HLC, 2012). Serbian legal experts and NGOs are arguing to have the law revised to be more inclusive, better reflecting the needs of victims, survivors and their families (Ristic, 2011).”",no,,1996,,1997,1997-01-01,,,https://reparations.qub.ac.uk/assets/uploads/1996-Serbia-Law-of-Civilian-Invalids.pdf,0,0,1,1,0,1,,yes,no,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,no,,,no,yes,no,no,don't know,no,unknown,no,,,,0,Loi sur les invalides civils de guerre,389,"compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage); rehabilitation (UNGA: ""medical and pyschological care as well as legal and social services"")",,other,state government,no stated goals,,,domestic law,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations)",legislative act,relatives of victims; victims,,Serbia,2025-01-07

126,20,Aboriginal Healing Foundation,Aboriginal Healing Foundation,1892-1990s,"The Aboriginal Healing Foundation was a Canadian government-funded, Aboriginal-run, not-for-profit that operated from 1998-2014. It provided funding for community healing initiatives to address the legacy of physical and sexual abuse perpetrated at Indian Residential Schools that operated from 1892 through the 1990s in some cases. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, formed by the Canadian Prime Minister in 1991, issued a final report in 1996 recommending, among other things, ""compensation of communities to design and administer programs that help the healing process and rebuild their community life” (RCAP final report, 10.1(e), quoted in Full Circle: The Aboriginal Healing Foundation and the Unfinished Work of Hope, Healing, and Reconciliation by Wayne K. Spear). In response, the Canadian Government through the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Jane Stewart, issued Gathering Strength: Canada’s Aboriginal Action Plan. A cornerstone of the plan was to create a fund of $350 million CAD called the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. As a result of negotiations between Aboriginal groups and the Canadian Government, only proposals which addressed the legacy of physical and sexual abuse at Indian Residential Schools would be eligible for funding, however, the AHF found creative ways to fund services to alleviate mental and emotional trauma and well (Spear 37). “The healing initiatives were designed by independent individuals, communities and institutions that secured funding through project proposals approved by the AHF” (Centre for Public Impact). The AHF funded projects run by organizations across Canada to provide counselling programs, support groups, family and wellness programming, and other similar services to survivors of Indian Residential Schools and their families (https://www.ahf.ca/funded-projects).",no,,1998,1998-03-30,1998,1998-04-01,2014,2014-09-30,chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.ahf.ca/downloads/gathering-strength.pdf,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,yes,Aboriginal Healing Foundation,yes,76,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,no,,,no,no,yes,no,,yes,$537 million CAD,yes,,2004 and 2007,expanded reparations policy,0,Fondation autochtone de guérison,,,,application process,state government; domestic donor,reconciliation; other (specify below),"violation-based community (group of individuals who suffered the same form of human rights violation); social identity-based community (group of individuals who share a cultural, ethnic, racial, or other identity)","social services (e.g. creating, reforming, and/or funding health or educational services, job training services, legal or housing assistance services, etc., to benefit the victim community[ies])",domestic law,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations); mental/emotional (psychological or mental health challenge or condition resulting from violations)",executive,,offices located around the country,Canada,2025-01-07

The reparations are framed as a way to honor those who fought on behalf of Kosovo’s independence and the victims of that fight rather than compensating people for crimes against humanity which were largely being dealt with through the courts. This new law was a response to extensive activism and international pressure to compensate victims of sexual violence through a reparations paradigm that was established previously in 2011 (although it had not been practically implemented). This coding focuses only on the amendment Law No. 4/L-172 because it created a separate reparations program for sexual violence survivors; see the coding for Law No.04/L-054 for the original law. The amendment to the original reparations policy adds survivors of sexual violence to the list of beneficiaries in the previous law. The main benefit they receive is compensation in the form of a monthly pension of €230, which Amnesty International deems “adequate, in its own right, in recognizing the physical and mental harm done to [the survivors] and the ongoing loss, suffering, and moral damage they continue to experience” (“Wounds that Burn Our Souls” 36). In some cases this compensation is transformative, removing survivors dependence on their families, allowing them to pay for health care, and even to start businesses. Survivors are also entitled to receive “health services abroad; access to employment in the public and private sector, through a rehabilitation programme; release from property tax; and some priority in access to housing” (see Amnesty International Report “Wounds that Burn Our Souls” p34). As Amnesty International points out, these benefits were not tailored to the needs of sexual violence survivors. Amnesty’s report argues that these other services survivors are entitled to are not meaningful. The benefit of health care abroad is inadequate: survivors need access to medical and psychological care at home. The law has not done much to enable access to employment for women, who are underemployed to begin with: only 17% of working age women and girls are employed, compared to 46.8% of men (as of 2017 when Amnesty’s report was published). As for release from property tax, fewer than 20% of women in Kosovo own property, so this is not an especially helpful benefit. However, the compensation piece of the legislation is a big step forward for survivors of sexual violence. Survivors can either apply directly to the Verification Commission created by the 2014, through representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, or through the four NGOs working with survivors. Although the law was passed in 2014, the Verification Commission to operate the law was not established until May 2017. Survivors were not able to apply for reparations until January 2018. The law provides for a 5-year period in which applications can be accepted. Also, Article 5 of the law prohibits beneficiaries from receiving more than one pensions. Therefore, survivors who are already receiving a pension, for example as the carer of a war invalid, relative of a missing person, or even as a retiree, will have to choose which pension to receive. Amnesty rightly points out that pensions received for past work or due to age should not be confused with or substitutable for compensation for harm done.

133,850,Reintegration Program,Reintegration Program,1989-2005,"The Aceh insurgency was fought by the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) from 1976-2005 with the goal of making the Indonesian province of Aceh independent. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami helped make the peace process politically possible because it weakened GAM and drew international attention to Indonesia, and thus to the conflict. The government of Indonesia and GAM signed a peace agreement in August 2005, giving Aceh autonomy while remaining a part of the Republic of Indonesia in return for GAM’s disarmament. The Aceh Peace-Reintegration Agency (BRA – Badan Reintegrasi Aceh) was established in 2006 to implement the reintegration commitments made in the Helsinki Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2005 between the Government of Indonesia and the Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM – Free Aceh Movement), including management of a Reintegration Fund. BRA is a ‘non-structural’ government body that is directly under the Governor of Aceh. Thus, the Governor is ultimately responsible for BRA’s performance. BRA was first established by Governor’s Decision 330/032/2006 in February 2006 by the Interim Governor Mustafa Abubakar. The reintegration program envisaged in the Peace MoU includes rehabilitation of public and private property, as well as farming land, employment and/or sufficient social security for former GAM combatants, amnestied political prisoners and conflict victims. The total amount of budget until 2010 is USD 225.9 million. Included in this program is economic empowerment assistance and compensation. BRA had invited all individuals and groups that were considered eligible by the MoU to apply for economic empowerment assistance by submitting proposals. The agency was unprepared for and incapable to address the tens of thousands of proposals that flooded its Banda Aceh office, and it requested assistance from the World Bank (Avonius, 2011). In 2006, the World Bank’s sub-district development program (KDP) was used to channel BRA’s ‘economic empowerment’ funds to communities rather than to individuals. “The Community‐based Reintegration Assistance for Conflict Victims (or BRA‐KDP) channeled over USD 20 million to 1,724 conflict‐affected villages across 67 sub‐districts in 17 districts from August 2006 to August 2007” (World Bank Report, 2009). “BRA, with technical assistance from the World Bank, adapted the community-based block grant mechanism utilized by the Government of Indonesia’s Kecamatan Development Program (KDP) to empower communities to decide who is a victim and what kind of assistance victims would receive. All villages within the targeted sub-districts received block grants ranging from Rp. 60 million (USD 6,000) to Rp. 170 million (USD $17,000) depending on the intensity of past conflict in the sub-district and the village population size” (World Bank Report, 2009). The compensation program is called Diyat. Diyat is a program based on the Quranic principle that compensation of one hundred camels should be paid to the victim’s family in the case of intended or unintended murder. The dilemma of how to calculate the number of camels in Indonesian Rupiah has characterised the diyat program throughout its existence. Initially, three million Rupiah was paid per household. In 2005, the diyat program focused on assisting the families of village chiefs, mukim, and civil servants who had been killed during the conflict. In 2006,the numbers have grown rapidly since then and the current number of verified eligible recipients is almost 30,000 families. In order to clarify how much and for how long each family would need to receive diyat assistance, the BRA Head Nur Djuli organised in early 2009 a consultative meeting with government departments and experts on the matter. The meeting came up with a recommendation that the total sum paid per family should be fifteen million Rupiah, to be paid over a five-year period. The Provincial Government requested that the national government shall allocate budget for Diyat. It is not clear how much, if any, funds were eventually spent on the diyat program in 2010, but at least no provincial budget funds were used for this purpose. The MoU indicates only three eligible categories for reintegration assistance: former GAM combatants, amnestied political prisoners, and civilians affected by the conflict reintegration assistance and 25,426 more remains.

As such, there was widespread internal displacement and property damage both in South Ossetia (by the Russian border) and throughout Georgia. As part of a reconciliatory effort with South Ossetia, the Georgian government passed a property restitution law. The law is meant to either provide restitution or compensation for lost property.

Families of individuals killed during the 2010 ""red shirt"" protests were eligible for compensation, as well as individuals who had been detained for political reasons. Under the terms of the policy, families of those killed would receive 3.25 million baht (about $100,000 U.S.) (BBC 2012). Later in 2012, additional funds were set aside to compensate individuals who had suffered political imprisonment. Depending on the length of the detention, victims were eligible for up to 1.5 million baht (about $45,000 U.S.) each (The Nation Thailand, 2012).” (Bridget) Thai security forces killed about 90 people protesting the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva between March and May 2010. These were “red-shirt'' protesters, also known as the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD): supporters of ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. In 2012, the Truth for Reconciliation Commission of Thailand, formed after the protests in 2010, recommended the government pay compensation to 500 people who had been detained in relation to the political violence arising from the rally of the People’s Alliance for Democracy in late 2005 and demonstrations by the red shirts in April and May 2010. The compensation fund was recommended by the Truth for Reconciliation Commission of Thailand and enacted by ex-Prime Minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, and her Cabinet. Notably, the Prime Minister who approved the reparations, Yingluk Shinawatra, is the sister of Thaksin Shinawatra, whose ousting was the subject of the 2010 red shirt protests.

This is an unusual reparations scheme with two parts: compensation (victims directly compensated by the Lebanese government) and adoption (“individuals, institutions, or foreign states could adopt an area and directly contribute to its reparation and reconstruction process”, Ghosn and Khoury 2013, p8). Through the adoption scheme, some of the foreign actors worked closely with the Lebanese government but others, like the governments of Kuwait and Qatar, bypassed the Lebanese government to compensate Lebanese citizens directly. For example, Qatar set up its own administrative body, Qatar Rehabilitation Program for South Lebanon, to compensate Lebanese victims directly. It should be noted that while the Lebanese government, foreign governments, and local and international actors carried out reconstruction projects like rebuilding infrastructure and sanitation projects, these were not collective reparations because they were not implemented explicitly to alleviate harm caused by human rights violations.

The amount awarded to each individual depended on the number of approved claimants, as the state set aside $10 million to be split amongst them. Notably, the state established the Office of Justice for Sterilization Victims under the NC Department of Administration to help victims collect documentation and file claims. The law also provides for an outreach program to notify those who may be eligible to receive compensation.

104,850,Community-based Reintegration Assistance for Conflict Victims,Community-based Reintegration Assistance for Conflict Victims (BRA-KDP),1976-2005,"The Aceh insurgency was fought by the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) from 1976-2005 with the goal of making the Indonesian province of Aceh independent. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami helped make the peace process politically possible because it weakened GAM and drew international attention to Indonesia, and thus to the conflict. The government of Indonesia and GAM signed a peace agreement in August 2005, giving Aceh autonomy while remaining a part of the Republic of Indonesia in return for GAM’s disarmament. The Aceh Peace-Reintegration Agency (BRA – Badan Reintegrasi Aceh) was established in 2006 to implement the reintegration commitments made in the Helsinki Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2005 between the Government of Indonesia and the Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM – Free Aceh Movement), including management of a Reintegration Fund. BRA had invited all individuals and groups that were considered eligible by the MoU to apply for economic empowerment assistance by submitting proposals. The agency was unprepared for and incapable to address the tens of thousands of proposals that flooded its Banda Aceh office, and it requested assistance from the World Bank (Avonius, 2011). In 2006, the WB’s sub-district development program (KDP) was used to channel BRA’s ‘economic empowerment’ funds to communities rather than to individuals. “The Community‐based Reintegration Assistance for Conflict Victims (or BRA‐KDP) channeled over USD 20 million to 1,724 conflict‐affected villages across 67 sub‐districts in 17 districts from August 2006 to August 2007” (World Bank Report, 2009). “BRA, with technical assistance from the World Bank, adapted the community-based block grant mechanism utilized by the Government of Indonesia’s Kecamatan Development Program (KDP) to empower communities to decide who is a victim and what kind of assistance victims would receive. All villages within the targeted sub-districts received block grants ranging from Rp. 60 million (USD 6,000) to Rp. 170 million (USD $17,000) depending on the intensity of past conflict in the sub-district and the village population size” (World Bank Report, 2009). The Indonesian government budgeted $150M USD for 2005 to 2007 for a Reintegration Fund to provide economic and other forms of assistance (e.g. land restitution, employment training, medical services) to conflict affected people. From Bridget: “In 2006, the BRA invited conflict-affected people to submit proposals for assistance. The BRA quickly became overwhelmed when they received 48,500 requests for assistance. As an alternative to individual administrative reparations, the BRA decided to partner with the GoI and the World Bank and utilize the already existing (Indonesia wide) Kecamatan Development Program (KDP) to offer community reparations. The KDP was a joint World Bank GoI community development program first launched in 1998 as a response to the Asian financial crisis.”",yes,,2006,,2006,,2007,,,1,0,1,1,0,1,,yes,yes,Aceh Peace-Reintegration Agency (BRA – Badan Reintegrasi Aceh),yes,,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,no,,,no,no,yes,no,don't know,yes,USD $20 million,no,,,,0,Assistance communautaire à la réintégration des victimes de conflits,366,,,application process; other,state government; foreign donor,compensation,geographic-based group (group of individuals with the same relation to a location),"physical infrastructure (e.g. building dams, roads, bridges, or providing clean water, etc); social services (e.g. creating, reforming, and/or funding health or educational services, job training services, legal or housing assistance services, etc., to benefit the victim community[ies]); collective compensation (lump sum provided to a community)",domestic law; peace agreement,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations); mental/emotional (psychological or mental health challenge or condition resulting from violations); economic (loss of income, job/employment, assets, or property resulting from violations)",executive,,,Indonesia,2025-01-07

Students and citizens across the country engaged in a series of protests against the new government. On May 18, 1980, citizens began protesting the implementation of nationwide martial law. The new military government deployed special force paratroopers to Gwangju to suppress the protests. The paratroopers attacked the protestors, further aggravating the situation and causing the demonstrations to grow. On May 21, 1980, soldiers opened fire on citizens leaving hundreds of people injured or dead. The people continued to resist for 10 days, in which 165 citizens died in and around Gwangju, 76 people went missing, 3,383 were injured, and 1,476 were arrested, affecting 5,100 in total. Furthermore, 102 people later died due to injuries acquired during the siege (UNESCO Memory of the World). On August 6, 1990 the National Assembly passed a law providing compensation for victims of the Gwangju massacre, and 2,224 victims (including those injured and families of the dead and missing) received a total of 142.8 billion won (Wolman). In both 1993 and 1997, the law was broadened to include more victims. A 1995 amendment changed the language of the law to refer to ""reparations,"" a term explicitly implicating the authoritarian government for abuse of power, and thus providing an additional measure of symbolic reparation to the victims (Han 2005, 1033). Two additional policies relate to reparations for the Gwangju incident. First, compensatory measures were adopted by the authoritarian government immediately following the events. While the government continued to evade responsibility, this compensation does represent a reparation policy of sorts (Han 2005, 1030-1032). Second, an Act on the Honorable Treatment of Persons of Distinguished Services to [the] May 18 Democratization Movement was passed on 26 January 2002.

Pablo De Greiff (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006): “Although reparations were discussed at the multi-party negotiations at the end of apartheid, the new democratic constitution that came out of these negotiations did not provide for reparations. The legislation that created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), however, established a special committee (the Committee on Reparations and Rehabilitation or CRR) to formally examine the reparations issue and make policy recommendations to the President. The CRR made its recommendations – widely considered to be one of the world’s most ambitious and comprehensive reparations policies – in the TRC’s 1998 Report. However, the South African government did not respond to these recommendations, arguing that since the work of other committees within the TRC was not yet finished, it could not considered the CRR’s proposed policy. Victim groups and civil csociety disagreed, and an acrimonious conflict ensued over the perceived slow pace of government action on reparations. Victims also pursued lawsuits for reparations against multinational corporations that conducted business with the apartheid government. In 2003, the government finally enacted a reduced version of the CRR’s original reparations policy.” On November 12, 2003, South Africa’s Department of Justice and Constitutional Development issued a set of Regulations in a Schedule to the National Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995. The Regulations outlined the reparations policy as it was to be implemented. The Regulations entitled an “identified victim” (meaning “a person who has been found by the Commission to be a victim of a gross violation of human rights”) to a once-off reparation grant of R 30,000. Appendix I of Volume 5 of the 1998 Truth Commission final report contained a list of gross human rights violations. The broad categories of gross human rights violations outlined in Appendix I are: killing, abduction, torture, and severe ill treatment. This is also the definition of gross human rights violations used in the 1995 Act. However, under each of these broad categories is a list of violations.

92,315,Act on Judicial Rehabilitation (Act No. 119/1990),(Czechoslovakia) Act on Judicial Rehabilitation (Act No. 119/1990),25 February 1948 (the communist takeover) to 29 December 1989 (the election of Va´clav Havel as president),"The text of the Act on Judicial Rehabilitation (Act No. 119/1990) is only available in Czech. From Bridget Marchesi: The Czech Republic reparation policy concerned only the most serious injustices committed by the communist regime between 1948 and 1989, and relieved victims on a very limited scale, as the massive scope of repression and a devastated economy made it impossible to remedy all human rights violations as provided by international human rights law (David and Choi Yuk-ping 2005, 397-398). The reparations policy encompasses many domestic law provisions, but principally: the 1990 Act on Judicial Rehabilitation, the 1991 Law on Extrajudicial Rehabilitation, and the 1993 Act on the Illegality of the Communist Regime and on the Resistance Against It, compensating former political prisoners (David 2012). The Act on Judicial Rehabilitation (Act No. 119/1990 of April 23, 1990) was the first law to be implemented and it had several objectives: first, to invalidate all judicial decisions concerning acts that contravened civic and politics rights guaranteed by the constitution and international accords; second, to eliminate disproportional hardship resulting from repression; third, to provide persons with social rehabilitation and adequate material compensation; and fourth, based on these findings, to determine that those persons who violated laws would consequently face legal repercussions. The act applied to injustices committed during the entire communist era between 25 February 1948 (the communist takeover) and 29 December 1989 (the election of Vaclav Havel as president). The law envisioned two kinds of rehabilitation: for people sentenced for political crimes that automatically became null and void and those would require a new investigation in the individual circumstances of the trial (VariousAuthors 1995, 572). Pursuant to the law, unjust criminal judgments concerning subversion, treason and other political crimes were cancelled by the parliamentary act (ex lege). Those cases which did not clearly fall within the list of political crimes could be reopened. Financial compensation was paid to surviving victims or the heirs of those who were executed or died in detention (David and Choi Yuk-ping 2005, 399). Former political prisoners were entitled to receive CSK 2,500 for each month of imprisonment, as well as other additional remedies and compensation for salary losses, health damages, legal fees, and judicial fines; however, the latter could not exceed CSK 30,000 per year in total. The period of detention and imprisonment was also taken into account for the purposes of rectifying injustices in the pensions of former political prisoners. (David 2012, 769). If the losses were deemed to be higher than CSK 2,500, appeals for higher compensation could be addressed to the ministries of justice. The victims of communist persecution had to apply for redress within six months of rehabilitation (VariousAuthors 1995, 585). Immediate relatives, widows and children, of those executed or that died in prison or labour camps could apply for compensation for loss of financial support. As an alternative to lump-sum cash compensation, the law offered CSK 15-20 for each month spent in prison or labour camp in addition to the deceased's monthly pension, that under the law could not be more than CSK 3,800 a month (VariousAuthors 1995, 574). The inadequate financial compensation and the limited number of persons entitled to such compensation led to the approval of subsequent laws. Act No. 87/1991 of February 21, 1991, on Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation provided for the alleviation of material injustices and furthered social rehabilitation of victims. The law applied to Czechoslovak citizens not convicted and sentenced by a court but who were otherwise harmed for social and political reasons; it provided for the rehabilitation and compensation of people dismissed from their jobs, imprisonment without trial, or forced by a court to sell the property or donate it to the state - providing for their return or financial compensation if return if not possible (VariousAuthors 1995, 578). Act No. 198/1993 on the Illegality of the Communist Regime and on the Resistance Against It was approved on July 9, 1993, and provided a legal framework for further compensation of former political prisoners. The law authorised the government to issue directives in order to compensate former political prisoners. Thus, government directive No. 165/1997 concerning the payment of one off compensation to alleviate some wrongs created by the Communist regime was issued in 1997, which amounted to CSK 625 for each month of imprisonment. Former political prisoners also enjoyed other material support, including free public transport, organisational subsidies, special medical treatment and modest spa subsidies (David and Choi Yuk-ping 2005, 399). In 2001, Act No. 261/2001 compensated persons imprisoned in military labour camps. In 2002, government directive No. 102/2002 compensated persons in military camps of forced labour, including the infamous Auxiliary Technical Battalions and Act No. 172/2002 compensated persons who were abducted to the USSR, or who were otherwise detained in camps run by the USSR in other states. In 2009, government directive No. 122/2009 compensated university students who had not been permitted to complete their education for political reasons and government directive No. 135/2009 compensated persons rehabilitated by the rehabilitation law in 1990, awarding CSK 1,800 for each month of imprisonment or detention (David 2012, 770-771). According to official statistics, between July 1990 and December 1992, over 36,000 rehabilitated individuals were indemnified in the amount of nearly 2 billion crowns [$ 80 million] (VariousAuthors 1995, 575). A problem, which consequently negatively impacted upon victims, was the fact that financial compensation was paid in two installments in 1990 and 1995: victims were entitled to receive a maximum of CSK 30,000, whilst the remaining amount was to be awarded in the form of government bonds since the depleted economy could hardly afford lump-sum payments. On the other hand, members of the repressive apparatus received generous packages for leaving posts. Many political prisoners were disappointed with the government for compensating secret policemen, prison wardens and torturers in lump sum immediately (David and Choi Yuk-ping 2005).",no,,1990,,,,,,http://www.proyectos.cchs.csic.es/transitionaljustice/sites/default/files/maps/info/personal-rehabilitation/czech_judicial_rehabilitation_1990.pdf,1,1,0,0,0,0,,no,don't know,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,no,,,no,yes,no,no,no,no,"Between July 1990 and December 1992, $80 million was spent on reparations.

The Act was a political compromise and expedient to end the war between the RF and Zimbabwe rather than an attempt to truly reconcile the country and repair victims.

In 1998, the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army and affiliated Isatabu Freedom Movement portrayed ethnic Malaitan settlers as land-grabbers and began to force them from their homes at gunpoint. The violence extended to other settlers. Soon, the Malaita Eagle Force formed to resist the GRA/IFM. The violence lasted until 2003. The reparations scheme referred to in the Townsville Peace Agreement of 2000 was poorly implemented and poorly documented. The scheme supposedly compensated people who suffered loss or damage to property on Guadalcanal as a result of the conflict, including or loss of employment opportunities, investments, businesses, and personal properties. The scheme neglected to compensate for other human rights violations that occurred during the conflict. In reality, the government made payments for claims of injury, displacement, and other violations, but under no uniform system. The government also had no policy or guidelines to regulate the distribution of compensation. Little attempt was made to classify or quantify claims. Therefore, there was no consistency or equity in the awarding of reparations. Furthermore, the Government’s record-keeping was scanty. The Truth Commission Report records that the first list of claimants was paid a total of $SBD140 million, but there is no official government record of these payments, nor of any subsequent payments. In the end, the Ministry of National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace, which was responsible for the implementation of the compensation scheme, overpaid $SBD13.8 million, much of it spent on suspect and dubious claims.",no,,2001,,,,,,"No written policy existed.

On 11 March 2004, the Bolivian Legislature adopted Law 2640 on Exceptional Reparation to Victims of Political Violence during Unconstitutional Governments (Law CONREVIP) through legislation. Article 3 of the law stipulates that direct victims, widows or widowers, heirs, and successors of said victims would benefit from the law. There is no data regarding the origin of the policy. Article 4 of the law states that beneficiaries would be entitled to reparation having suffered from the following abuses: arbitrary detention; torture; exile; serious physical injury (lesiones e incapacidad calificadas); death inside or outside the country resulting from political violence; forced disappearance; and, persecution for political reasons. Article 4 states that reparation will be dependent on the presentation of suitable and legal proof of abuse. Article 10 explains that requests must be made within 60 days of the establishment of the law. Furthermore, reparations is not available to Bolivian citizens who remained in exile after the return of democratic rule, to those who have held positions in the parliament or executive power more than once, to those who are already received any other form of damage from the Bolivian State, and to those who held positions within the apparatus of repression during the dictatorship. The policy does not foreclose victims from resorting to other justice mechanisms. Article 6 of the law outlines the types of reparations afforded by the law. These include: free health care, including medical attention, surgery, mental health and rehabilitation, to those who have no other medical coverage, and medicine; and economic benefits of up to a maximum of 300 times the minimum wage for victims and their legal successors based on the extent of the political violence suffered. It also covers burial expenses. In April and May 2012 a new law (Law 238, passed by the Plurinational Legislative Assembly) and a decree (Supreme Decree 1211) were passed according to which the compensation amounts established in the 2004 law would be reduced. The Law created the National Commission for Compensation to Victims of Political Violence (CONREVIP) charged with receiving, considering and ruling on requests made for reparations. The Ministry of Justice chairs the Commission. As of 2012, of the approximately 6,200 applicants only 1,714 have qualified as beneficiaries; of these no more than 800 have received any compensation.

86,451,Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission,23 March 1991 – 1 March 2002,"Sierra Leone's Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended reparations in Vol 2, chapter 4. In making the recommendations, the TRC was “guided by the provisions of the Lomé Peace Agreement of 7 July 1999 and its enabling legislation, the TRC Act of 22 February 2000” (TRC, Vol 2, Chapter 4, p 227). From Justiceinfo.net:""The TRC devoted an entire chapter of its final report to recommend comprehensive reparation measures for the most vulnerable survivors – amputees, severely war-wounded, survivors of sexualized violence and war-widows. The chapter foresaw pensions, free healthcare, education benefits and much more. Sierra Leone’s government reluctantly agreed to implement the recommendations, but failed to take any action for four years. It required pressure from Sierra Leone’s biggest survivor organization, the Amputee and War-Wounded Association (AWWA) and a 3.5 million USD grant from the UN Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) to kickstart reparation efforts in 2008. The International Organization for Migration helped create a reparations unit in the National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) and with the help of the International Center for Transitional Justice 33,863 survivors were registered. Yet, from the beginning, major stumbling blocks appeared. The proposal to the PBF foresaw that the government would raise additional funds through special taxes, a debt-relief-for-reparation-scheme and other measures – none of which were implemented. The lack of funds, operational challenges and disadvantageous PBF regulations forced a change of course. Instead of implementing the TRC recommendations as planned, each registered survivor received an interim-relief payment of 100 USD to bridge the time gap until more comprehensive reparation could be delivered."" From US Institute of Peace: ""The National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) was designated by the government to implement the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Beginning in August 2008, the government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations implemented a one-year project aimed at building the institutional capacity to implement the TRC recommendations related to reparations.

Although the Act compensated those who had been wrongfully convicted or imprisoned on charges of sedition and espionage during the martial law period, it did not overturn the convictions, thereby “shielding the repressive measures’ authors and implementers from personal accountability” (Roth). Importantly, “The [White Terror] Compensation Act did not acknowledge the illegality of the trials by court martial but instead referred to these judgments as “wrongful” (or “improper”)” (Cheng 88). A committee created by the Act would review the cases to determine if they were decided wrongfully.
