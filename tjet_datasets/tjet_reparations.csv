The first phase, spanning from 1991 to 1997, marked the initial efforts to acknowledge and compensate individuals imprisoned for political reasons. During this time, political prisoners were notably more effective in advocating for both material and symbolic reparations. This period saw the enactment of three key pieces of legislation: a 1991 law, the Status Law in 1993, and the controversial Genocide Law in 1995—each reflecting the relative influence of former political detainees in shaping public policy at the time. However, the unstable political environment following the collapse of communism, along with attempts to politicize the victims’ experiences and a general lack of political commitment, meant that many of the promises made—including financial compensation—remained largely unfulfilled. The second phase, from 1997 to 2005, was marked by stagnation in reparation efforts. Notably, individuals from the former communist leadership who had been convicted in 1993 for misusing public funds or under the 1995 Genocide Law were released in 1997. The entire legal process surrounding their convictions and subsequent release was shrouded in secrecy, with minimal public information available. Even many of the political prisoners interviewed for this research recalled little detail about this period, reflecting its lack of transparency and activity in the realm of reparations. The third phase, covering 2007 to 2013, saw a revival of the reparation process. In 2007, the government passed legislation specifically addressing financial compensation for former political prisoners and their relatives. However, actual disbursement of compensation did not begin until 2009, following a series of public demonstrations by survivors. According to some interviewees, a turning point in the reparation movement came in 2009, when a former political prisoner tragically self-immolated during a protest—an event that drew significant public and political attention and is further discussed in the following sections. The government pledged more than $400 million in compensation for the families of over 15,000 individuals who were either imprisoned or lost their lives under Enver Hoxha’s authoritarian rule, which spanned from 1946 to 1985. This announcement follows years of persistent advocacy by survivors and their families. According to legislation passed in 2007, former political prisoners are entitled to 2,000 Albanian lek (roughly $18) for each day spent behind bars. However, there has been some dissatisfaction with the amount, with critics arguing that it falls short when compared to the reparation standards established in other post-communist countries in Eastern Europe.",domestic law,,legislative act,no,2007,2007-11-12,2009,,2023,,,compensation,,1,1,0,0,,0,0,application process,100000,yes,don't know,,,,state government,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,,0,no,,,no,0,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations)",yes,compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage),victims,no,,,yes,don't know,don't know,,1,27386,27386,"USD $11,499,760.32",,,,,2025-07-22

The Charter also establishes a widespread amnesty for security forces and armed Islamist groups who hand over their weapons. The Charter incorporates Executive Decree 97-49 of 12 February 1997 and Executive Decree 99-47 of 13 February 1999, which order compensation for victims and beneficiaries of those harmed in accidents in the anti-terrorist struggle, as well as victims of human rights abuses committed by armed groups. The Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation was approved in a public referendum with 98% approval in September 2005. Presidential Decree 05-278 and Ordinance No 06-02 passed by the Algerian cabinet on February 27, 2006 granted the implementation of the charter. The Charter was established by the President Abdelaziz Bouteflika as a way to bring about a lasting peace between the government and rebel forces. The aim of the Charter was to compensate for the families of victims that suffered disappearances or extrajudicial killings. Also, the Charter introduced compensation measures for economically poor families of persons who were alleged terrorists. In order for relatives of disappeared victims to be eligible for compensation they must obtain a certificate that their relative is missing from the judicial police. After receiving this certificate, they must obtain a death certificate through an administrative ruling within two months of having received the certificate. Relatives of those who were implicated in terrorist acts (and killed) could receive compensation via a judicial police certificate that confirms their relative died as a member of an armed group. However, they must also obtain a certificate from the local wali that demonstrates that they are a materially poor. Families must obtain a certificate that their relative is missing within one year of the implementation of the Charter (February 2006). They must then claim compensation within six months in order to be eligible. Children of victims who are older than 19 and are currently studying are not eligible for compensation, under the assumption that they are financially autonomous. Some of the claims for compensation have been implemented, although certain victims claim that money they were awarded was never disbursed. According to the Chair of the unit in charge of implementing the charter, as of 2011, 6,541 disappeared persons have been recorded, with 6,400 families receiving compensation for their disappearances. According to the ICTJ, at least 7,000 people were disappeared, with more than 150,000 people killed during the decade long conflict.

The policy offered a pension to relatives of people that had disappeared during the dictatorship. It was enacted through Law 23.466, that was sanctioned on October 30th, 1986. Its objective was to replace the financial support that human rights organizations had been giving since the dictatorship, when the deterioration of the country's economy affected the capacity of these organizations to continue offering such support. The pension was equivalent to the 75% of a minimum wage (and to a minimum perceived by a retired public servant in case of disability) It included medical assistance and medicines. The persons who could claim benefits were: 1.Children younger than twenty-one years of age whose parents had disappeared. 2.The surviving husband or wife or someone who had lived with the victim for a minimum of five years immediately preceding the disappearance. 3.Disabled parents or siblings who did not perform any profitable activity and who did not enjoy pensions, retirement benefits, or tax-free benefits. 4.Orphan siblings who had lived regularly with the victim before the disappearance. In the case of sons and daughters of disappeared people, the benefit was suspended after they reached 21 years old. Later the limit was extended to 25 or when they received their university degrees. The rest of the benefits had no interruption. Law 23.466 was sanctioned on October 30th, 1986; it was regulated through decree No. 1228/87. The law did not exclude the exercise of any civil law action.

144,Argentina,160,Decreto 70/91,Decree 70/91,Décret 70/91,"Before December 10, 1983","Benefits are established for those persons who had been placed at the disposal of the NATIONAL EXECUTIVE BRANCH by an act emanating from it, before December 10, 1983, and who, having initiated a lawsuit for compensation for damages for this reason before December 10, 1985, had not obtained satisfaction because the statute of limitations had been upheld by a final judgment. A one-time payment to people who were detained by order of the President during the state of siege before December 10, 1983, and filed a claim for damages before December 10, 1985, that was barred by statutes of limitations. Decree No. 70/91 gave compensation to former political prisoners. Beneficiaries were individuals who had been imprisoned during the authoritarian regime and who had initiated a trial for damages before December 10, 1985, and whose judicial action had been declared null. Beneficiaries were also individuals who had initiated trials for damages. The latter could choose whether to continue with the trial or to accept the benefits of the decree. The catalyst of the policy was the demands of former prisoners (of those whose demands for damages had been rejected by the local judiciary) that reached the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in the context of IACHR recommendations. 227 people received the reparation assigned by the decree. From Guembe (2006): According to the interpretation of his highest-ranked official in human rights, President Menem's intention was, on the one hand, to earn the respect of the Organization of American States (OAS) by complying with the decisions of its institutions, and on the other, to implement a policy that would redress his own former colleagues involved in political activism who had been victims of the dictatorship just as he had. Beneficiaries of this decree were persons who under state of siege had been in the custody of the national executive branch, and who complied with the following requirements: they had filed a lawsuit for indemnification for harms and damages before December 10, 1985 and a nonappealable judgment had ruled that the statute of limitations had expired; or they had filed a lawsuit whose proceedings were already underway when the decree was enacted. Those with ongoing proceedings could chose to continue with them, and if their cases were eventually dismissed on statute of limitations grounds, they could avail themselves of the benefits offered by this decree. Alternatively, they could withdraw their case and claim the amount for indemnification provided by this decree. This amount equaled one‐thirtieth of the monthly salary assigned to the highest category of the Roster of Civil Servants of the National Public Administration [Escalafón para el Personal Civil de la Administración Pública Nacional] for each day of detention. The decision to set the compensation at the level of what is earned by the highest‐ranked civil servant had a special meaning for the government. Alicia Pierini, Undersecretary for Human and Social Rights in Menem's government, explains: The way in which this amount was fixed has to do with the idea of reparation rather than with indemnification. What we wanted was to pay, for each day of the detention, what the State's public servant of the highest rank, who could not work, would have earned. This implied breaking away from labor rights criteria and those of accidents in the workplace. Imprisonment was no accident and Menem agreed, this is why the discussion was won. The decree explicitly provided for an increase in the amount of compensation for the cases in which the victims died or suffered from severe injuries, in the terms expressed in article 91 of the Penal Code. According to this law, severe injuries are defined as those causing a ‘physical or mental illness, certainly or probably incurable, permanent work disabilities, the loss of one sense, an organ, a member, the use of an organ or a member, loss of speech, or the capacity to beget or conceive’. Decree 70/91 proclaimed that if the detainee died during detention, the benefit would be established in the same way as with the other cases of detention for the period calculated until the moment of death, but, owing to the death, would include the amount equivalent to what is provided by this law for five years of detention. In case of severe injuries, there would be an increase in the benefit equivalent to 70 percent of the additional amount awarded in cases of death. According to this decree, $27 was paid for each day of the detention. Payments were made in cash. According to information provided by the Secretariat of Human and Social Rights, approximately 227 persons received this reparations measure. In cases of death, the benefit was calculated as follows: $27 was paid for each day of the detention plus $49,275, which was the amount for five years of detention. In cases of severe injuries, $27 was paid for each day of the detention plus $34,492, which was the equivalent of 70 percent of the amount for five years. Up to this date, no official data has been published regarding the amounts of the reparations paid. This makes it impossible to estimate the resources that the State has allocated for the implementation of this decree. According to article 12 of the decree, the necessary expenses to comply with this norm were to be charged to the State's assets. Applications for claiming benefits had to be filed before the Ministry of the Interior, which had to verify ‘expeditiously’ the duration of detentions, and then the necessary payments. If an application was rejected, an appeal could be filed within ten days before the ordinary courts, which had 20 days to resolve the case. Payments were supposed to be made in cash within 60 days of the approval of the application. In case the payment was not made, it could be judicially claimed through the normal procedure established for the execution of sentences.42 Those who received a benefit—in case of the victim's death, his or her successors could claim the benefit —had to renounce any further right to indemnification for damages. In the stated motivation for this decree, the executive branch recognized that this measure was not meant to be a substitute for justice but to correct unfair situations provoked by the strict application of existing law.",domestic law,,executive,no,1991,1991-01-10,1991,1991-01-10,1994,,,compensation,https://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/5000-9999/5378/norma.htm,1,1,1,0,,0,0,application process,23358,yes,yes,"Ministry of Justice, Security, and Human Rights",yes,1470,state government,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,0,don't know,,,no,0,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations)",yes,compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage),relatives of victims; victims,no,,,yes,yes,no,,1,12939,12939,1.17 billion pesos (in 1994),no,Law 24.043 and Law 26.564,1992,expanded reparations policy,2025-07-22

Argentinians were upset that the government was only compensating forced detention and not the disappeared, which prompted the government to go back and create this new law to include the disappeared as well. Brief Description: Law 24.411 of December 1994 recognized financial reparation to the victims of forced disappearance and to the families of the individuals who were assassinated before 1983 by the military, by the paramilitary or by the members of security forces. In August 2004, President Nestor Kirchner completed the policy of reparations regarding disappearances. Policy Details: The policy was an initiative of the party in government in 1994. Law 24.411 was sanctioned on December 1994 at midnight, with only a few coincidences and without parliamentary debate because the reparation of the victims of forced disappearance presented many conflicts. These conflicts were not publicly discussed. First, the biggest fear of the victims was that the State was distributing benefits in exchange for silence about what had happened to the disappeared, or for the impunity of the individuals who were responsible for the disappearances. Second, Law 24.411 recognized financial reparation to the victims of forced disappearance. The victims themselves could not accept the reparation (because they were disappeared), but neither could their relatives unless they accepted the fact the disappeared were dead. The ""Ley de Ausencia por Desaparicion Forzada"" (Law 24.321 of May 1994) acknowledged that the individual is absent because it was illegitimately kidnapped by agents of the State; the law regulated how individuals could be recognized as such. Hence, it was agreed that the individual disappeared would be legally defined as disappeared, and that the money given by the state would be given in name of the victims. Law 24.321: Certification of enforced disappearance, allowing relatives (up to the 4th degree) to initiate a judicial process to declare the absence due to enforced disappearance. This is not strictly a reparation law, but it was a necessary regulation to enable compensation for forced disappearance without declaring the missing persons dead. (Guembe email communication) Law 24.823 of May 23, 1997 (a ""ley parche"") amended Law 24.411 and proclaimed that under no circumstance the intervening judge could declare the death nor fix the presumed date of the death of a victim of forced disappearance. Law 24.823 also facilitated access to compensation for the heirs of victims of forced disappearance or of people who were killed by the Armed Forces, Security Forces or paramilitary groups before December 10, 1983. Law No. 24.823. An amendment was introduced to Law No. 24.411 to facilitate access to compensation for the heirs of victims of forced disappearance or of people that were killed by the Armed Forces, Security Forces or paramilitary groups before December 10, 1983.

Through Law 23.982 the government authorized payments through of consolidation of public debt. These bonds expired 16 years after they were issued. Law 26.564: Expansion of the benefits provided by Laws 24.043 and 24.411. (Guembe email communication) In 2009, Law No. 26.564 extends the benefits that were established by laws 24.043 and 24.411 to five distinct groups: (i) those who were victims of forced disappearance or detained or killed between June 16, 1955, and December 9, 1983, under the conditions and circumstances established in the aforementioned laws; (ii) those who were victims of actions by rebels in the events of June 16, 1955, and September 16, 1955, whether the acts were committed by members of the Armed Forces, security or police forces, or by paramilitary groups or civilians incorporated de facto into any of the forces; (iii) members of the Armed Forces who were in active duty at the time of the rebellion and were were defamed, marginalized, and/or dismissed from the force for refusing to take part in the coup, (iv) those who were detained, prosecuted, convicted and/or at the disposal of civilian courts or War Councils in accordance with Decree No. 4161/55, the Conintes Plan and/or Laws 20.840, 21.322, 21.323, 21.325, 21.264, 21.463, 21.459 and 21.886.

Law 25.914 of August 30, 2004 offers reparation to individuals who were born while their mothers were illegally detained. It is directed to children who remained in detention due to the detention or disappearance of their parents for political reasons by orders of the national executive branch or military tribunals. It is also directed to those individuals who were the victims of identity substitution. Practice Implementation: According to Law 24.411, first, the victim had to be acknowledged as being absent due to forced disappearance by a judge. The range of evidence that could be presented for validating claims of forced disappearances was broad. After such recognition, the relatives of the disappeared could solicit financial reparation under law 24.411 . The judge who had presided over the case of absence by forced disappearance would be competent to dictate the declaration of assignees. This declaration would have similar effects to those of the declaration of heirs. 3.082.960.000$ were given to the victims. 8.540 individuals received reparations for forced disappearance and murder. According to Law 25.914 of 2004, individuals who suffered identity substitution are to receive an indemnification equivalent to the one fixed by Law 24.411: $224,000 Argentinean pesos. The victims of the other crimes receive a benefit that consists of a one-time payment equivalent to 20 times the monthly earnings of a government employee Level A, Grade 8, of the National System of the Administrative Profession: $71,288 pesos. The individual must prove that his or her mother was detained or disappeared. The victims of identity substitution must present a judicial sentence rectifying their identity. The benefit increases by 50 percent for those persons who suffered severe injuries. In the case of the victim's death as a result of these crimes, the amount increases by 100 percent.

On 11 March 2004, the Bolivian Legislature adopted Law 2640 on Exceptional Reparation to Victims of Political Violence during Unconstitutional Governments (Law CONREVIP) through legislation. Article 3 of the law stipulates that direct victims, widows or widowers, heirs, and successors of said victims would benefit from the law. There is no data regarding the origin of the policy. Article 4 of the law states that beneficiaries would be entitled to reparation having suffered from the following abuses: arbitrary detention; torture; exile; serious physical injury (lesiones e incapacidad calificadas); death inside or outside the country resulting from political violence; forced disappearance; and, persecution for political reasons. Article 4 states that reparation will be dependent on the presentation of suitable and legal proof of abuse. Article 10 explains that requests must be made within 60 days of the establishment of the law. Furthermore, reparations is not available to Bolivian citizens who remained in exile after the return of democratic rule, to those who have held positions in the parliament or executive power more than once, to those who are already received any other form of damage from the Bolivian State, and to those who held positions within the apparatus of repression during the dictatorship. The policy does not foreclose victims from resorting to other justice mechanisms. Article 6 of the law outlines the types of reparations afforded by the law. These include: free health care, including medical attention, surgery, mental health and rehabilitation, to those who have no other medical coverage, and medicine; and economic benefits of up to a maximum of 300 times the minimum wage for victims and their legal successors based on the extent of the political violence suffered. It also covers burial expenses. In April and May 2012 a new law (Law 238, passed by the Plurinational Legislative Assembly) and a decree (Supreme Decree 1211) were passed according to which the compensation amounts established in the 2004 law would be reduced. The Law created the National Commission for Compensation to Victims of Political Violence (CONREVIP) charged with receiving, considering and ruling on requests made for reparations.

It provided funding for community healing initiatives to address the legacy of physical and sexual abuse perpetrated at Indian Residential Schools that operated from 1892 through the 1990s in some cases. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, formed by the Canadian Prime Minister in 1991, issued a final report in 1996 recommending, among other things, ""compensation of communities to design and administer programs that help the healing process and rebuild their community life” (RCAP final report, 10.1(e), quoted in Full Circle: The Aboriginal Healing Foundation and the Unfinished Work of Hope, Healing, and Reconciliation by Wayne K. Spear). In response, the Canadian Government through the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Jane Stewart, issued Gathering Strength: Canada’s Aboriginal Action Plan. A cornerstone of the plan was to create a fund of $350 million CAD called the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. As a result of negotiations between Aboriginal groups and the Canadian Government, only proposals which addressed the legacy of physical and sexual abuse at Indian Residential Schools would be eligible for funding, however, the AHF found creative ways to fund services to alleviate mental and emotional trauma and well (Spear 37). “The healing initiatives were designed by independent individuals, communities and institutions that secured funding through project proposals approved by the AHF” (Centre for Public Impact).

The JPL provided reparations for civilian victims of the right wing paramilitary groups that were part of the broader umbrella organization, the AUC. The reparations program was started as accompanying legislation to a peace deal that the government signed with the AUC in 2003 and was formalized in 2005, the same year as the JPL. Importantly, the JPL compensates victims of the AUC, not members of the AUC who were victims or victims of the government, even if the violence was related to paramilitaries. The initiative aimed to acknowledge and support individuals affected by the violence through measures such as financial compensation, restitution of property, and rehabilitative services. The legislation takes an inclusive approach to identifying victims, recognizing both individuals and groups who experienced harm due to breaches of international humanitarian law or serious human rights violations occurring from January 1, 1985, onward. This definition encompasses harm inflicted by both illegal armed factions and state representatives. Additionally, it considers as victims the immediate family members of individuals who were killed or went missing during the conflict. Administered by the Colombian government, the program offered reparations to those impacted by a range of abuses, including forced displacement, murder, enforced disappearance, sexual violence, and economic harm resulting from the conflict. The initiative comprised various elements: financial compensation for economic losses, efforts to return confiscated or abandoned land to rightful owners, and symbolic gestures like public acknowledgments and memorials to honor and validate victims’ experiences and suffering.",domestic law,,legislative act,no,2005,2005-07-25,2006,2006-01-01,2011,,,reconciliation; recognition; accountability; coexistence,https://reparations.qub.ac.uk/assets/uploads/law-975-ingls-1.pdf https://www.fiscalia.gov.co/colombia/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ley-975-del-25-de-julio-de-2005-concordada-con-decretos-y-sentencias-de-constitucionalidad.pdf,0,0,1,1,289,1,0,application process,500000,yes,yes,"National Commission on Reparation and Reconciliation, National Prosecutorial Unit for Justice and Peace (Unidad Nacional de Fiscalía para la Justicia y la Paz)",yes,300,state government; domestic donor; foreign donor,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,other; rape; sexual slavery,0,yes,yes,no,no,1,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations); mental/emotional (psychological or mental health challenge or condition resulting from violations); fundamental rights (loss of rights like citizenship, freedom of religion or expression, etc. resulting from violations); economic (loss of income, job/employment, assets, or property resulting from violations)",yes,"compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage); restitution (UNGA: ""restore the victim to the original situation before the gross violations of international human rights law or serious violations of international humanitarian law occurred""); rehabilitation (UNGA: ""medical and pyschological care as well as legal and social services"")",relatives of victims; victims,yes,"symbolic (memorials, apologies, museums, etc); social services (e.g. creating, reforming, and/or funding health or educational services, job training services, legal or housing assistance services, etc., to benefit the victim community[ies]); collective compensation (lump sum provided to a community)","social identity-based community (group of individuals who share a cultural, ethnic, racial, or other identity); geographic-based group (group of individuals with the same relation to a location)",yes,no,no,confidentiality provisions for sensitive topics like sexual and gender-based violence; case worker services or other application assistance available,1,9081,9081,"USD $32,606,694",yes,2006: Gustavo Gallón Giraldo v.

The law was created in 2011, sixx years after the Justice and Peace Law created Colombia’s first reparations program for victims of the civil war versus the AUC (paramilitaries). The Victim’s Law was meant to cover victims of guerrilla groups and victims of the state despite there being no formal peace between the government and the active guerrilla groups. The legislation introduced a broad framework for reparations, truth and memory initiatives, and land restitution for individuals impacted by Colombia’s internal armed conflict. To support the implementation of these measures, the government established several dedicated institutions: the Victims’ Unit, the Land Restitution Unit, and the National Center for Historical Memory. Under this law, administrative compensation is defined as a one-time monetary award provided to specific categories of victims. The criteria for eligibility and the payment amounts are outlined in Executive Decree 4800 of 2011, rather than in the Victims’ Law itself. Eligible recipients include individuals who endured forced displacement, kidnapping, torture, sexual violence, forced recruitment, and severe or permanent injuries. Additionally, spouses, children, or parents of those who were killed or forcibly disappeared are also entitled to receive compensation. Victims subjected to multiple forms of harm may receive compensation for each type of violation, up to a maximum equivalent of 40 times the monthly minimum wage. The reparations established by Law 1448 aim to be comprehensive, encompassing not only financial compensation but also land restitution, access to healthcare, housing, and education, as well as vocational training. Victims can apply individually or as part of a group that experienced collective harm. Between 2011 and 2018, more than 8.6 million Colombians registered as victims of the conflict. However, by 2018, only about 7% of those eligible had received compensation, highlighting the government’s ongoing struggle to fulfill its commitments and the resulting challenges for achieving sustainable peace.",domestic law,,executive; legislative act,no,2011,2011-06-11,2012,2012-01-01,2016,2030-08-31,2030,non-recurrence / non-repetition; recognition; restitution,English: https://reparations.qub.ac.uk/assets/uploads/Victims-Law-1448-2011.pdf Spanish: https://www.unidadvictimas.gov.co/sites/default/files/documentosbiblioteca/ley-1448-de-2011.pdf,0,0,1,1,289,1,0,application process; other,9263826,yes,yes,Victims Unit,yes,3000,state government,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,forced pregnancy; rape; sexual slavery; forced sterilization; forced prostitution,0,yes,yes,no,no,1,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations); mental/emotional (psychological or mental health challenge or condition resulting from violations); fundamental rights (loss of rights like citizenship, freedom of religion or expression, etc. resulting from violations); economic (loss of income, job/employment, assets, or property resulting from violations)",yes,"compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage); restitution (UNGA: ""restore the victim to the original situation before the gross violations of international human rights law or serious violations of international humanitarian law occurred""); rehabilitation (UNGA: ""medical and pyschological care as well as legal and social services"")",relatives of victims; victims,yes,"physical infrastructure (e.g. building dams, roads, bridges, or providing clean water, etc); symbolic (memorials, apologies, museums, etc); social services (e.g. creating, reforming, and/or funding health or educational services, job training services, legal or housing assistance services, etc., to benefit the victim community[ies]); collective compensation (lump sum provided to a community)","social identity-based community (group of individuals who share a cultural, ethnic, racial, or other identity); geographic-based group (group of individuals with the same relation to a location)",yes,no,yes,confidentiality provisions for sensitive topics like sexual and gender-based violence; case worker services or other application assistance available; policy available in multiple languages; offices located around the country,1,1295568,1295568,USD$2.2 billion in reparations so far,yes,,2013,expanded reparations policy,2025-07-22

Some information in this form is taken from the CDVR final report’s section on reparations, and some is taken from information released about CONARIV. The law that created CONARIV, ordonnance 2015-174, is not available online. Because of this, the answers to many of the questions in the “policy” and “implementation” sections are unknown. CONARIV was created on March 24, 2015. It compiled a list of 316,954 victims to compensate for violations that occurred between 1990-2011 during various civil wars and post-election violence (see https://www.ictj.org/location/costa-de-marfil). Human Rights Watch reports that about 4,500 victims were compensated by CONARIV's implementation partner, the National Program for Social Cohesion (PNCS), in an initial round of reparations in 2015. It is unclear whether CONARIV and PNCS compensated any other victims, though I found no verifiable reports. On July 3, 2017, CONARIV passed responsibility for the policy to the Ministry of Women, Child Protection, and Solidarity. From Bridget Marchesi: The CONARIV's goal is to complete the work of its predecessor, the Commission for Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation (CDVR), and respond to the government's desire to provide reparations to the victims. The CONARIV's main missions are to identify and make an inventory of the remaining victims who are entitled to reparations and then compensate them based on a single, consolidated data base. There’s also another mission, which was not mentioned in the law under which we were established, and that is reconciliation.

The Czech Republic reparation policy concerned only the most serious injustices committed by the communist regime between 1948 and 1989, and relieved victims on a very limited scale, as the massive scope of repression and a devastated economy made it impossible to remedy all human rights violations as provided by international human rights law (David and Choi Yuk-ping 2005, 397-398). The reparations policy encompasses many domestic law provisions, but principally: the 1990 Act on Judicial Rehabilitation, the 1991 Law on Extrajudicial Rehabilitation, and the 1993 Act on the Illegality of the Communist Regime and on the Resistance Against It, compensating former political prisoners (David 2012). The Act on Judicial Rehabilitation (Act No. 119/1990 of April 23, 1990) was the first law to be implemented and it had several objectives: first, to invalidate all judicial decisions concerning acts that contravened civic and politics rights guaranteed by the constitution and international accords; second, to eliminate disproportional hardship resulting from repression; third, to provide persons with social rehabilitation and adequate material compensation; and fourth, based on these findings, to determine that those persons who violated laws would consequently face legal repercussions. The act applied to injustices committed during the entire communist era between 25 February 1948 (the communist takeover) and 29 December 1989 (the election of Vaclav Havel as president). The law envisioned two kinds of rehabilitation: for people sentenced for political crimes that automatically became null and void and those would require a new investigation in the individual circumstances of the trial (VariousAuthors 1995, 572). Pursuant to the law, unjust criminal judgments concerning subversion, treason and other political crimes were cancelled by the parliamentary act (ex lege). Those cases which did not clearly fall within the list of political crimes could be reopened. Financial compensation was paid to surviving victims or the heirs of those who were executed or died in detention (David and Choi Yuk-ping 2005, 399). Former political prisoners were entitled to receive CSK 2,500 for each month of imprisonment, as well as other additional remedies and compensation for salary losses, health damages, legal fees, and judicial fines; however, the latter could not exceed CSK 30,000 per year in total. The period of detention and imprisonment was also taken into account for the purposes of rectifying injustices in the pensions of former political prisoners. (David 2012, 769). If the losses were deemed to be higher than CSK 2,500, appeals for higher compensation could be addressed to the ministries of justice. The victims of communist persecution had to apply for redress within six months of rehabilitation (VariousAuthors 1995, 585). Immediate relatives, widows and children, of those executed or that died in prison or labour camps could apply for compensation for loss of financial support. As an alternative to lump-sum cash compensation, the law offered CSK 15-20 for each month spent in prison or labour camp in addition to the deceased's monthly pension, that under the law could not be more than CSK 3,800 a month (VariousAuthors 1995, 574). The inadequate financial compensation and the limited number of persons entitled to such compensation led to the approval of subsequent laws. Act No. 87/1991 of February 21, 1991, on Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation provided for the alleviation of material injustices and furthered social rehabilitation of victims. The law applied to Czechoslovak citizens not convicted and sentenced by a court but who were otherwise harmed for social and political reasons; it provided for the rehabilitation and compensation of people dismissed from their jobs, imprisonment without trial, or forced by a court to sell the property or donate it to the state - providing for their return or financial compensation if return if not possible (VariousAuthors 1995, 578). Act No. 198/1993 on the Illegality of the Communist Regime and on the Resistance Against It was approved on July 9, 1993, and provided a legal framework for further compensation of former political prisoners. The law authorised the government to issue directives in order to compensate former political prisoners. Thus, government directive No. 165/1997 concerning the payment of one off compensation to alleviate some wrongs created by the Communist regime was issued in 1997, which amounted to CSK 625 for each month of imprisonment. Former political prisoners also enjoyed other material support, including free public transport, organisational subsidies, special medical treatment and modest spa subsidies (David and Choi Yuk-ping 2005, 399). In 2001, Act No. 261/2001 compensated persons imprisoned in military labour camps. In 2002, government directive No. 102/2002 compensated persons in military camps of forced labour, including the infamous Auxiliary Technical Battalions and Act No. 172/2002 compensated persons who were abducted to the USSR, or who were otherwise detained in camps run by the USSR in other states. In 2009, government directive No. 122/2009 compensated university students who had not been permitted to complete their education for political reasons and government directive No. 135/2009 compensated persons rehabilitated by the rehabilitation law in 1990, awarding CSK 1,800 for each month of imprisonment or detention (David 2012, 770-771). According to official statistics, between July 1990 and December 1992, over 36,000 rehabilitated individuals were indemnified in the amount of nearly 2 billion crowns [$ 80 million] (VariousAuthors 1995, 575). A problem, which consequently negatively impacted upon victims, was the fact that financial compensation was paid in two installments in 1990 and 1995: victims were entitled to receive a maximum of CSK 30,000, whilst the remaining amount was to be awarded in the form of government bonds since the depleted economy could hardly afford lump-sum payments. On the other hand, members of the repressive apparatus received generous packages for leaving posts. Many political prisoners were disappointed with the government for compensating secret policemen, prison wardens and torturers in lump sum immediately (David and Choi Yuk-ping 2005).",domestic law,,legislative act,no,1990,,,,1992,,,restitution; rehabilitation; other (specify below),http://www.proyectos.cchs.csic.es/transitionaljustice/sites/default/files/maps/info/personal-rehabilitation/czech_judicial_rehabilitation_1990.pdf,1,1,0,0,,0,0,,,no,don't know,,,,state government,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,,0,no,,,no,0,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations); economic (loss of income, job/employment, assets, or property resulting from violations)",yes,"compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage); restitution (UNGA: ""restore the victim to the original situation before the gross violations of international human rights law or serious violations of international humanitarian law occurred""); rehabilitation (UNGA: ""medical and pyschological care as well as legal and social services"")",relatives of victims; victims,no,,,no,no,no,,1,"According to official statistics, between 1990-2, between July 1990 and December 1992, over 36,000 rehabilitated individuals were indemnified",36000,"Between July 1990 and December 1992, $80 million was spent on reparations.

Women forcibly sterilized will receive 300,000 Czech crowns ($14,000 USD). Balkan Insider reports problems with the policy implementation. Campaigners for justice for the sterilized women accuse the Czech government of failing to allocate enough funds and mismanaging the rollout. The government apparently only set aside enough funds to cover compensation for 106 applicants, even though it was estimated that 400 women would be eligible for compensation. The campaigners say that the government has failed to do adequate outreach to potential applicants. Furthermore, they say the standard of proof is too high since many women affected no longer have the required documents from many years ago. A statement on the Ministry of Health’s website says that the processing time for claims is currently up to twice the time allotted in the policy (60 days). This is because the policy is being administered by Ministry officials on a part-time basis. Only one full-time staff position was created to administer the policy, and it has not been filled.

Individual one-off payments, which began on October 13, 2006, range from about US $217 to US $3,300 depending on the extent of abuse or violation. The US $1.5 million in payments were recommended by the National Reconciliation Commission (NRC) - formed in 2002 to investigate human rights violations committed under various governments since Ghana gained independence from Britain in 1957 (IRIN 2006). Policy Details Since gaining independence in 1957, Ghana experienced four coups and successive military regimes. Human rights violations such as arbitrary imprisonment, confiscation of property, disappearances, executions and torture, occurred under each of the military governments and intensified following the two coups initiated by former President J. J. Rawlings in 1979 and 1982 (IRIN 2006; Valji 2006). In its Final Report of 2004, the NRC urged the establishment of a comprehensive reparations policy. With regards to monetary compensation, the Report proposed amounts to be paid out to victims based on the types of violations suffered (Valji 2006). In an annex, ""the NRC provided an exhaustive list of 2,514 victims that it considered being eligible for reparations. 2,177 of them were to receive monetary compensation while the others restitution of their employment or of their property. For each individual, the NRC indicated the appropriate reparations measure (but not the violation) and, if applicable, the amount of compensation, reaching from USD $36 to 1,938 or 1-30m GHC"" (Ghana Cedi) (ETJN 2011, 10). Implementation The NRC recommended that compensation be paid to more than 2,500 people who suffered various abuses. The monetary payments total ¢12.2 billion. Money for the payment was released by the government in October 2006. A member of the NRC Implementation said that even though, as many as 4,000 people petitioned the NRC and were heard, only 2,514 people will be compensated: 2,117 will be given monetary compensation while the rest would be reinstated or have their property deconfiscated. Individual one-off payments, which began on October 13, range from about US $217 to US $3,300 depending on the extent of abuse or violation (ETJN 2011). The policy has been partially implemented. A total of 1,268 victims of human rights abuses have been paid close to ¢8 billion (Ghanaian Cedi) in reparation sums as recommended by the NRC by June 2007.

After the formal end of the conflict through a UN brokered peace process in the mid-1990s, the domestic government struggled to transition to democracy and implement transitional justice programs to the satisfaction of guarantors of the peace process. Under increasing pressure form international observers, the president at the time created a reparations program in 2003. In 2003, the National Compensation Program (PNR) was established by presidential decree under President Alfonso Portillo, bypassing the Guatemalan Congress due to its unwillingness to pass legislation guaranteeing legal and institutional support for reparations. The program was developed in response to the findings of the Commission for Historical Clarification (CEH) and sustained advocacy from victims’ associations and human rights groups. Its mission is to offer both individual and collective reparations to civilians affected by human rights abuses and crimes against humanity during the conflict. Originally planned to operate for a decade, the PNR was extended for another ten years in 2013. The PNR’s reparations strategy—often referred to as the “Blue Book”—comprises five core components: restitution of property, financial compensation, psychological support and rehabilitation, the dignification of victims, and cultural reparations. To access these benefits, families of victims must go to a PNR office and meet three main requirements: provide a personal account of the violations and identify those affected, present valid identification (DPI), and submit relevant birth or death certificates. After the documents are reviewed, a PNR legal advisor evaluates the case and assigns a file number, allowing victims to pursue one or more forms of reparation, provided additional conditions are met. As of more than 15 years since its creation, the PNR had processed and compensated around 30,000 victims—just a fraction of the 200,000 who were reported dead or missing, according to the CEH. In Guatemala, victims may pursue reparations through three main avenues: (1) the PNR, as the state’s administrative mechanism for compensating victims of wartime atrocities; (2) domestic court rulings in cases of human rights violations; and (3) decisions or recommendations issued by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights regarding individual cases.",domestic law,,executive,no,2003,2003-05-08,2005,2005-01-01,2023,2023-01-01,2023,reconciliation; compensation,https://reparations.qub.ac.uk/assets/uploads/Programa-Nacional-de-Resarcimiento-EN.pdf,1,1,1,1,233,0,1,application process,200000,yes,yes,National Reparations Commission,yes,,state government,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,rape,1,yes,yes,,no,1,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations); economic (loss of income, job/employment, assets, or property resulting from violations)",yes,"compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage); rehabilitation (UNGA: ""medical and pyschological care as well as legal and social services"")",relatives of victims; victims,yes,"physical infrastructure (e.g. building dams, roads, bridges, or providing clean water, etc)",other,yes,no,no,,1,"43,629",43629,USD$89.7 million,yes,,2013,expanded reparations policy,2025-07-22
133,Indonesia,850,Reintegration Program,Reintegration Program,Programme de réintégration,1989-2005,"The Aceh insurgency was fought by the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) from 1976-2005 with the goal of making the Indonesian province of Aceh independent. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami helped make the peace process politically possible because it weakened GAM and drew international attention to Indonesia, and thus to the conflict. The government of Indonesia and GAM signed a peace agreement in August 2005, giving Aceh autonomy while remaining a part of the Republic of Indonesia in return for GAM’s disarmament. The Aceh Peace-Reintegration Agency (BRA – Badan Reintegrasi Aceh) was established in 2006 to implement the reintegration commitments made in the Helsinki Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2005 between the Government of Indonesia and the Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM – Free Aceh Movement), including management of a Reintegration Fund. BRA is a ‘non-structural’ government body that is directly under the Governor of Aceh. Thus, the Governor is ultimately responsible for BRA’s performance. BRA was first established by Governor’s Decision 330/032/2006 in February 2006 by the Interim Governor Mustafa Abubakar. The reintegration program envisaged in the Peace MoU includes rehabilitation of public and private property, as well as farming land, employment and/or sufficient social security for former GAM combatants, amnestied political prisoners and conflict victims. The total amount of budget until 2010 is USD 225.9 million. Included in this program is economic empowerment assistance and compensation. BRA had invited all individuals and groups that were considered eligible by the MoU to apply for economic empowerment assistance by submitting proposals. The agency was unprepared for and incapable to address the tens of thousands of proposals that flooded its Banda Aceh office, and it requested assistance from the World Bank (Avonius, 2011). In 2006, the World Bank’s sub-district development program (KDP) was used to channel BRA’s ‘economic empowerment’ funds to communities rather than to individuals. “The Community‐based Reintegration Assistance for Conflict Victims (or BRA‐KDP) channeled over USD 20 million to 1,724 conflict‐affected villages across 67 sub‐districts in 17 districts from August 2006 to August 2007” (World Bank Report, 2009). “BRA, with technical assistance from the World Bank, adapted the community-based block grant mechanism utilized by the Government of Indonesia’s Kecamatan Development Program (KDP) to empower communities to decide who is a victim and what kind of assistance victims would receive. All villages within the targeted sub-districts received block grants ranging from Rp. 60 million (USD 6,000) to Rp. 170 million (USD $17,000) depending on the intensity of past conflict in the sub-district and the village population size” (World Bank Report, 2009). The compensation program is called Diyat. Diyat is a program based on the Quranic principle that compensation of one hundred camels should be paid to the victim’s family in the case of intended or unintended murder. The dilemma of how to calculate the number of camels in Indonesian Rupiah has characterised the diyat program throughout its existence. Initially, three million Rupiah was paid per household. In 2005, the diyat program focused on assisting the families of village chiefs, mukim, and civil servants who had been killed during the conflict. In 2006,the numbers have grown rapidly since then and the current number of verified eligible recipients is almost 30,000 families. In order to clarify how much and for how long each family would need to receive diyat assistance, the BRA Head Nur Djuli organised in early 2009 a consultative meeting with government departments and experts on the matter. The meeting came up with a recommendation that the total sum paid per family should be fifteen million Rupiah, to be paid over a five-year period. The Provincial Government requested that the national government shall allocate budget for Diyat. It is not clear how much, if any, funds were eventually spent on the diyat program in 2010, but at least no provincial budget funds were used for this purpose. The MoU indicates only three eligible categories for reintegration assistance: former GAM combatants, amnestied political prisoners, and civilians affected by the conflict reintegration assistance and 25,426 more remains.

The reparations are framed as a way to honor those who fought on behalf of Kosovo’s independence and the victims of that fight rather than compensating people for crimes against humanity which were largely being dealt with through the courts. This new law was a response to extensive activism and international pressure to compensate victims of sexual violence through a reparations paradigm that was established previously in 2011 (although it had not been practically implemented). This coding focuses only on the amendment Law No. 4/L-172 because it created a separate reparations program for sexual violence survivors; see the coding for Law No.04/L-054 for the original law. The amendment to the original reparations policy adds survivors of sexual violence to the list of beneficiaries in the previous law. The main benefit they receive is compensation in the form of a monthly pension of €230, which Amnesty International deems “adequate, in its own right, in recognizing the physical and mental harm done to [the survivors] and the ongoing loss, suffering, and moral damage they continue to experience” (“Wounds that Burn Our Souls” 36). In some cases this compensation is transformative, removing survivors dependence on their families, allowing them to pay for health care, and even to start businesses. Survivors are also entitled to receive “health services abroad; access to employment in the public and private sector, through a rehabilitation programme; release from property tax; and some priority in access to housing” (see Amnesty International Report “Wounds that Burn Our Souls” p34). As Amnesty International points out, these benefits were not tailored to the needs of sexual violence survivors. Amnesty’s report argues that these other services survivors are entitled to are not meaningful. The benefit of health care abroad is inadequate: survivors need access to medical and psychological care at home. The law has not done much to enable access to employment for women, who are underemployed to begin with: only 17% of working age women and girls are employed, compared to 46.8% of men (as of 2017 when Amnesty’s report was published). As for release from property tax, fewer than 20% of women in Kosovo own property, so this is not an especially helpful benefit. However, the compensation piece of the legislation is a big step forward for survivors of sexual violence. Survivors can either apply directly to the Verification Commission created by the 2014, through representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, or through the four NGOs working with survivors. Although the law was passed in 2014, the Verification Commission to operate the law was not established until May 2017. Survivors were not able to apply for reparations until January 2018. The law provides for a 5-year period in which applications can be accepted. Also, Article 5 of the law prohibits beneficiaries from receiving more than one pensions. Therefore, survivors who are already receiving a pension, for example as the carer of a war invalid, relative of a missing person, or even as a retiree, will have to choose which pension to receive. Amnesty rightly points out that pensions received for past work or due to age should not be confused with or substitutable for compensation for harm done. There are an estimated 20,000 wartime rape survivors in Kosovo. As of January 2023, only 1870 had applied for reparations.",domestic law,,legislative act,no,2014,2014-03-20,2017,2017-05-01,2023,2023-02-05,,no stated goals,https://reparations.qub.ac.uk/assets/uploads/04-L-172-a.pdf,1,0,1,1,412,0,1,application process,1870,yes,yes,Commission to Recognise and Verify Survivors of Sexual Violence During the Kosovo War (Verification Commission),yes,9,state government,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,other; rape,0,no,,,no,1,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations)",yes,"compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage); rehabilitation (UNGA: ""medical and pyschological care as well as legal and social services"")",victims,no,,,no,don't know,no,case worker services or other application assistance available; offices located around the country,1,800 as of June 2020,800,"In November 2017, the Minister of Finance allocated €1 million from the 2018 budget to go towards the policy.",yes,"This policy is the amendment to the original law passed in 2011, Law No.04/L-054 On the Status and the Rights of the Martyrs, Invalids, Veterans, Members of Kosovo Liberation Army, Sexual Violence Victims of the War, Civilian Victims of War and their Families.

Through the adoption scheme, some of the foreign actors worked closely with the Lebanese government but others, like the governments of Kuwait and Qatar, bypassed the Lebanese government to compensate Lebanese citizens directly. For example, Qatar set up its own administrative body, Qatar Rehabilitation Program for South Lebanon, to compensate Lebanese victims directly. It should be noted that while the Lebanese government, foreign governments, and local and international actors carried out reconstruction projects like rebuilding infrastructure and sanitation projects, these were not collective reparations because they were not implemented explicitly to alleviate harm caused by human rights violations.

The IAC faced many criticisms, including the“disparity in the amounts of individual awards and the lack of transparency in the Panel’s methodology for determining awards” (ICTJ, “Transitional Justice in Morocco: A Progress Report, 2005: 11). It also had a very short period in which to make applications, only 4 months (September 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999). It received a total of 5,127 claims during that period. Furthermore, claimants had to sign a document saying they would not appeal the IAC's decision. In the end, the IAC awarded approximately USD 100 million, compensating 7,700 victims and heirs.

Notably, the reparations policy was not created following either a civil war or transition to democracy but rather was authorized by the king. The IER was responsible for outlining a policy of reparations, collecting petitions for reparations, ruling on the petitions, and administering reparations. The policy awarded reparations for arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and violations associated with those events (torture, death, injury, sexual assault, etc.). The policy differentiated victims based on the type of harm suffered and their social situation (employment, administrative, and/or financial situation, among other things). Women could receive higher compensation than men, a recognition of the direct and indirect consequences of violence that women bear.

The conflict ended with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006. Following this agreement, the government created an interim relief program, technically called the Standard on Financial Assistance and Relief to the Conflict Victims. The program provided relief to families of the dead and disappeared (including widows and children), people with disabilities resulting from the conflict, people whose property was damaged because of the conflict, and people who were detained. Although the Relief and Rehabilitation Unit (established April 25, 2008 under the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction) was primarily responsible for distributing the assistance, there were also several district-level units. So, a family that had multiple conditions of victimhood had to go through each of these procedures separately to access different types of reparations (From Relief to Redress). “The task force documented the death of 18,030 persons, 1,613 disappeared, 80,222 IDPs, 9,820 disabled, 3,893 abducted or forcibly kidnapped, 2,094 illegally detained, 689 Orphan Children and, 1,735 injured requiring medical assistance” (“From Relief to Redress: Reparations in Post-Conflict Nepal”).

From May 1980 to November 2000, Peru endured the most intense period of violence in its modern history, as later documented by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CVR). In response to a recommendation from an inter-institutional working group, the transitional government formally established the Truth Commission on June 4, 2001. The Commission presented its final report to the public in August 2003. Following the CVR’s recommendation to create a Comprehensive Reparations Program—which would encompass both individual and collective support, including tangible and symbolic measures—the government introduced the Peace and Development Plan targeting regions most severely affected by the conflict. This plan focused largely on social development and infrastructure initiatives. The CVR emphasized that reparations must not be implemented in isolation, but rather as part of a broader transitional justice strategy. This includes uncovering the truth, preserving historical memory, holding perpetrators accountable, and undertaking institutional reforms. According to the CVR’s vision, reparations are actions taken by the state, reflecting society’s commitment to recognize the suffering endured by victims. These efforts are intended to restore victims’ dignity, affirm their full citizenship, and acknowledge the violations they experienced.

In 1999 and 2000, the law was amended to include a variety of human rights violations committed between 1940 and 1944 ""on ethnic or racial grounds"" (REDRESS, text of legislation). Decree-Law 118/1990 provided reparations in the form of compensation and benefits to people who had been wrongfully imprisoned, arrested, put in forced labor camps, forced into psychiatric wards, or forcefully deported between 1945-1989. Lavinia Stan (2013: 138) writes “The Decree-Law was seen as unsatisfactory by most communist-era victims, who suggested that the low compensation levels were inadequate and unable to cover their basic needs.” In Romania, decisions regarding eligibility for compensation due to political persecution—such as imprisonment, forced residence, internment, or resettlement—were made by local committees. These bodies could grant monthly payments of 200 lei (approximately $50) for each year an individual was subjected to such measures. During the first twenty years following the fall of communism, the Romanian government offered limited symbolic financial compensation for time spent in detention or displacement. These benefits included income tax exemptions and the recognition of years spent in prison or forced labor toward pension calculations. However, the exclusive focus on monetary compensation drew criticism, with some viewing it as an attempt to silence former political prisoners rather than genuinely acknowledge their suffering. Broader reparative efforts—such as public apologies, access to truth, and other non-financial forms of redress—were notably absent. Although a compensation program was introduced shortly after the fall of the Ceaușescu regime, it consisted largely of symbolic gestures and offered minimal financial relief. Later, Law No. 221 of June 2, 2009 aimed to address past political convictions and related administrative actions between March 6, 1945, and December 22, 1989.

As a result, “both the victims and courts overestimated the level of compensation that the impoverished Romanian state could afford” (ibid.). In October 2010, Romania’s Constitutional Court declared the law’s compensation provisions unconstitutional because the law entitled victims and relatives to equal compensation, and because it failed to cap the amount of compensation (ibid.).

This compensation is generally reserved for those who fought a war and their families, not civilians who suffered violence and human rights abuses. However, there are two categories of war invalids: military invalids and civilian invalids. The specifics of the reparations policy outlined here refer only to what is relevant to civilian invalids (Humanitarian Law Center, 2007). A civilian war invalid is specifically defined as a civilian ""whose degree of bodily damage sustained as a result of a wound, injury or trauma is at least 50 percent."" The Ministry for Social Affairs interprets the law such that only those injuries suffered on Serbia, no other territory of the former Yugoslavia, are eligible for reparations. Families of civilians who died as a result of wounds or injuries sustained due to the war have a right to monthly compensation only if their income is below a level established in Serbian law. In 2007, there was no official number of those killed or families who received or were entitled to compensation. Additionally, families of those who are missing have the possibility of obtaining monthly compensation; however, they must declare the missing person dead and few actually know about this program (HLC, 2007, 49). Compensation varies according to injury sustained. First-category invalids (suffered gravest harm) receive compensation equivalent to an average salary in Serbia, augmented by 80 percent. It is also possible to receive additional compensation, such as care and assistance benefits, orthopedic implements, supplement, and monthly unemployment benefit. Lesser categories of injuries receive a smaller amount of compensation depending on the gravity of their injury (HLC, 2007). For low-income families of civilians who were killed compensation amounted 14, 750 dinars (187 euros), far less than was paid to families of veterans. As of late 2007, 1,972 people received monetary compensation and other benefits based on their status as civilian war invalid (HLC, 2007). Given the limited nature of the reparations program others have sought compensation in court proceedings against the Republic of Serbia (HLC, 2012). Serbian legal experts and NGOs are arguing to have the law revised to be more inclusive, better reflecting the needs of victims, survivors and their families (Ristic, 2011).”",domestic law,,legislative act,no,1996,,1997,1997-01-01,,,,no stated goals,https://reparations.qub.ac.uk/assets/uploads/1996-Serbia-Law-of-Civilian-Invalids.pdf,0,0,1,1,389,0,1,other,,yes,no,,,,state government,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,,1,no,,,no,0,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations)",yes,"compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage); rehabilitation (UNGA: ""medical and pyschological care as well as legal and social services"")",relatives of victims; victims,no,,,no,don't know,no,,0,unknown,,unknown,no,,,,2025-07-22
86,Sierra Leone,451,Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Commission vérité et réconciliation de la Sierra Leone,23 March 1991 – 1 March 2002,"Sierra Leone's Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended reparations in Vol 2, chapter 4. In making the recommendations, the TRC was “guided by the provisions of the Lomé Peace Agreement of 7 July 1999 and its enabling legislation, the TRC Act of 22 February 2000” (TRC, Vol 2, Chapter 4, p 227). From Justiceinfo.net:""The TRC devoted an entire chapter of its final report to recommend comprehensive reparation measures for the most vulnerable survivors – amputees, severely war-wounded, survivors of sexualized violence and war-widows. The chapter foresaw pensions, free healthcare, education benefits and much more. Sierra Leone’s government reluctantly agreed to implement the recommendations, but failed to take any action for four years. It required pressure from Sierra Leone’s biggest survivor organization, the Amputee and War-Wounded Association (AWWA) and a 3.5 million USD grant from the UN Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) to kickstart reparation efforts in 2008. The International Organization for Migration helped create a reparations unit in the National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) and with the help of the International Center for Transitional Justice 33,863 survivors were registered. Yet, from the beginning, major stumbling blocks appeared. The proposal to the PBF foresaw that the government would raise additional funds through special taxes, a debt-relief-for-reparation-scheme and other measures – none of which were implemented. The lack of funds, operational challenges and disadvantageous PBF regulations forced a change of course. Instead of implementing the TRC recommendations as planned, each registered survivor received an interim-relief payment of 100 USD to bridge the time gap until more comprehensive reparation could be delivered."" From US Institute of Peace: ""The National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) was designated by the government to implement the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Beginning in August 2008, the government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations implemented a one-year project aimed at building the institutional capacity to implement the TRC recommendations related to reparations. This project received $3 million USD from the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund. A total of 29,733 victims have been registered. As of early 2010, amputees, war wounded and victims of sexual violence received a $100 USD interim payment. The NaCSA has partly started to implement other reparative measures such as educational support and health care, and the government in 2009 launched the Victims’ Trust Fund provided for in the Lomé Peace Agreement of 1999 and the TRC Act of 2000."" According to the ICTJ report (Suma and Correa), 20,107 victims received the interim payments: 6,934 children; 1,135 amputees; 4,375 other war wounded; 4,745 war widows; and 2,918 victims of sexual violence.",domestic law; peace agreement; truth commission,,legislative act,no,2004,2004-10-05,2008,2008-08-01,2012,,,non-recurrence / non-repetition; reconciliation,https://reparations.qub.ac.uk/assets/uploads/Volume2Chapter4-2.pdf,1,1,1,1,382,0,1,application process,29733,yes,yes,"National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA), a semi-autonomous government agency",yes,,foreign donor,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,rape; sexual slavery,1,yes,yes,no,no,1,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations); mental/emotional (psychological or mental health challenge or condition resulting from violations); economic (loss of income, job/employment, assets, or property resulting from violations)",yes,"compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage); rehabilitation (UNGA: ""medical and pyschological care as well as legal and social services"")",relatives of victims; victims,yes,"physical infrastructure (e.g. building dams, roads, bridges, or providing clean water, etc); symbolic (memorials, apologies, museums, etc); social services (e.g. creating, reforming, and/or funding health or educational services, job training services, legal or housing assistance services, etc., to benefit the victim community[ies])",geographic-based group (group of individuals with the same relation to a location),yes,don't know,yes,confidentiality provisions for sensitive topics like sexual and gender-based violence; policy available in multiple languages; offices located around the country,1,"20,107",20107,"Approx. $4.1 million USD (from two UN Peacebuilding Fund grants, 2008-9 and 2011-12).",no,,,,2025-07-22

The Bona Fide Demands of the Indigenous People of Guadalcanal was first submitted in 1988 by a group of Guadalcanal politicians and public officers to the Solomon Island Government headed by Prime Minister Ezekiel Alebua. The Guadalcanal leaders demanded state government (like a semi-autonomous government in a federal system) and the reduction of internal migration from Malaita (another island in the Solomon Islands), among other things. The Solomon Island Government’s failure to meet the Bona Fide Demands helped spark the conflict. In 1998, the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army and affiliated Isatabu Freedom Movement portrayed ethnic Malaitan settlers as land-grabbers and began to force them from their homes at gunpoint. The violence extended to other settlers. Soon, the Malaita Eagle Force formed to resist the GRA/IFM. The violence lasted until 2003. The reparations scheme referred to in the Townsville Peace Agreement of 2000 was poorly implemented and poorly documented. The scheme supposedly compensated people who suffered loss or damage to property on Guadalcanal as a result of the conflict, including or loss of employment opportunities, investments, businesses, and personal properties. The scheme neglected to compensate for other human rights violations that occurred during the conflict. In reality, the government made payments for claims of injury, displacement, and other violations, but under no uniform system. The government also had no policy or guidelines to regulate the distribution of compensation. Little attempt was made to classify or quantify claims. Therefore, there was no consistency or equity in the awarding of reparations. Furthermore, the Government’s record-keeping was scanty. The Truth Commission Report records that the first list of claimants was paid a total of $SBD140 million, but there is no official government record of these payments, nor of any subsequent payments. In the end, the Ministry of National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace, which was responsible for the implementation of the compensation scheme, overpaid $SBD13.8 million, much of it spent on suspect and dubious claims.",domestic law; peace agreement,,,no,2001,,,,,,,,"No written policy existed.

Pablo De Greiff (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006): “Although reparations were discussed at the multi-party negotiations at the end of apartheid, the new democratic constitution that came out of these negotiations did not provide for reparations. The legislation that created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), however, established a special committee (the Committee on Reparations and Rehabilitation or CRR) to formally examine the reparations issue and make policy recommendations to the President. The CRR made its recommendations – widely considered to be one of the world’s most ambitious and comprehensive reparations policies – in the TRC’s 1998 Report. However, the South African government did not respond to these recommendations, arguing that since the work of other committees within the TRC was not yet finished, it could not considered the CRR’s proposed policy. Victim groups and civil csociety disagreed, and an acrimonious conflict ensued over the perceived slow pace of government action on reparations. Victims also pursued lawsuits for reparations against multinational corporations that conducted business with the apartheid government. Prior to 2003, there had been a slow-moving Urgent Interim Reparations Program (UIR). In 2003, the government finally enacted a reduced version of the CRR’s original reparations policy. On November 12, 2003, South Africa’s Department of Justice and Constitutional Development issued a set of Regulations in a Schedule to the National Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995. The Regulations outlined the reparations policy as it was to be implemented. The Regulations entitled an “identified victim” (meaning “a person who has been found by the Commission to be a victim of a gross violation of human rights”) to a once-off reparation grant of R 30,000. Appendix I of Volume 5 of the 1998 Truth Commission final report contained a list of gross human rights violations. The broad categories of gross human rights violations outlined in Appendix I are: killing, abduction, torture, and severe ill treatment. This is also the definition of gross human rights violations used in the 1995 Act. However, under each of these broad categories is a list of violations. Under the 2003 Regulations, identified victims of these violations were eligible for reparations. Importantly, sexual and gender-based violence, while not explicitly listed in the 2003 Regulation, are repaired. They are classified under “torture” in TRC Final Report, Vol 5, Appendix I. No distinctions were made based on severity or financial status. Severity was too difficult to quantify and financial status required the kind of complicated and costly ‘means testing’ that would be too difficult to apply to the 22,000 applicants on the final list of victims The TRC's Final Report in 2003 made the case that reparations are a moral requirement of the transition out of apartheid. The report links reparations to the moral integrity of the TRC process and reminds the government that it is ‘morally obliged to carry the debts of its predecessors and is thus equally responsible for reparations’. The Report argues in favor of individual grants amounting to USD$2,713 (median annual household income for a family of five). Those in rural areas or with more dependents would receive more, up to $2,878. From 2018 to 2022, the Fund has received R531-million in investment revenue but only disbursed R98-million in reparations.

Students and citizens across the country engaged in a series of protests against the new government. On May 18, 1980, citizens began protesting the implementation of nationwide martial law. The new military government deployed special force paratroopers to Gwangju to suppress the protests. The paratroopers attacked the protestors, further aggravating the situation and causing the demonstrations to grow. On May 21, 1980, soldiers opened fire on citizens leaving hundreds of people injured or dead. The people continued to resist for 10 days, in which 165 citizens died in and around Gwangju, 76 people went missing, 3,383 were injured, and 1,476 were arrested, affecting 5,100 in total. Furthermore, 102 people later died due to injuries acquired during the siege (UNESCO Memory of the World). On August 6, 1990 the National Assembly passed a law providing compensation for victims of the Gwangju massacre, and 2,224 victims (including those injured and families of the dead and missing) received a total of 142.8 billion won (Wolman). In both 1993 and 1997, the law was broadened to include more victims. A 1995 amendment changed the language of the law to refer to ""reparations,"" a term explicitly implicating the authoritarian government for abuse of power, and thus providing an additional measure of symbolic reparation to the victims (Han 2005, 1033). Two additional policies relate to reparations for the Gwangju incident. First, compensatory measures were adopted by the authoritarian government immediately following the events. While the government continued to evade responsibility, this compensation does represent a reparation policy of sorts (Han 2005, 1030-1032). Second, an Act on the Honorable Treatment of Persons of Distinguished Services to [the] May 18 Democratization Movement was passed on 26 January 2002. This act provides a number of additional benefits to victims of the Gwangju events, such as reduced or exempted tuition fees, employment support, medical treatment, and others (full text of the act available at UNESCO 2011, 41-60).",domestic law,,legislative act,no,1990,1990-08-04,,,,,,no stated goals,,1,1,0,0,,0,0,application process,,don't know,don't know,,,,state government,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,,1,no,,,no,0,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations)",yes,compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage),relatives of victims; victims,no,,,don't know,don't know,no,,1,"2,224 victims (including injured and relatives of the missing and dead)",2224,142.8 billion Won,yes,,1993,expanded reparations policy,2025-07-22

Following the transition to democracy, the Spanish government enacted a series of laws to provide reparations to those unjustly imprisoned during that era. One of the first measures, Law 46/1977, introduced shortly after the end of the regime, granted financial compensation to individuals detained for political reasons under Franco. The law offered up to 100,000 pesetas for each year of imprisonment, with a maximum payout of 1,000,000 pesetas per person. Additional compensation was available for victims who endured torture or abuse while incarcerated. Later, Law 18/1984 broadened the scope of eligibility by including those imprisoned for reasons unrelated to politics, such as religious beliefs or labor-related offenses. This legislation also offered up to 100,000 pesetas per year of imprisonment, with a higher cap of 1,500,000 pesetas for each individual.",domestic law,,legislative act,no,1977,1977-10-15,1979,,2006,,,compensation,,1,1,0,0,,0,0,application process,60427,don't know,yes,Comisión Interministerial,don't know,,state government,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,0,no,,,no,0,,yes,compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage),relatives of victims; victims,no,,,no,,no,,1,60427,60427,"397 million euros for imprisonment, 2.8 million euros for democracy fighters, 624,000 euros for LGBTQ+ people",yes,,1984,expanded reparations policy,2025-07-22

However, as Spain got distance from Francoism and more official historical record about the Franco years came to light, there were strong calls to engage more with transitional justice. From this came the reparations program created in 2007 to compensate and victims and their families for violations during the Franco regime. Spain’s Law 52/2007, enacted on December 26 and commonly referred to as the “Historical Memory Law” (Ley de Memoria Histórica), was designed to acknowledge and make amends to those who suffered under the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and the Franco dictatorship (1939–1975). The law provides financial compensation to individuals who were imprisoned during the Franco era. Those who spent at least three years in prison are eligible for a payment of €6,010.12, with an additional €1,202.02 for every three extra years served. If the victim is deceased, a payment of €9,616.18 may be granted to their surviving spouse. Furthermore, individuals who died defending democratic values between 1969 and 1977 may be eligible for a lump sum of €135,000. Several factors led to the adoption of this legislation. One was Spain’s increasing role in international human rights efforts, which brought attention to unresolved issues in its own recent history. Another was the rise of a younger generation that had not lived through the dictatorship and was more open to addressing past injustices. Lastly, the law was introduced at a politically favorable moment and was intentionally limited in scope to secure the necessary legislative support. While the 2007 law does not overturn the rulings from Francoist courts, it does officially reject the legitimacy of those judicial bodies and the politically motivated sentences they issued. It also allows individuals affected by such rulings to request a formal declaration recognizing their suffering and acknowledging the injustice they endured due to laws rooted in ideological or religious discrimination.

Under the terms of the policy, families of those killed would receive 3.25 million baht (about $100,000 U.S.) (BBC 2012).

The compensation fund was recommended by the Truth for Reconciliation Commission of Thailand and enacted by ex-Prime Minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, and her Cabinet.

Seven were shot dead, and another 78 were crushed or suffocated to death in army vans transporting them to a military detention camp (Amnesty International, 2012). Similar instances of excessive force occurred in 2004 in Krue Se and Saba Yoi, also in the southern region of the country (The Nation [Thailand], 2012). The clashes occurred in the context of an ongoing insurgency in the region, home to a large population of Malay Muslims. In 2012, it was announced that the families of individuals killed in the three incidents listed above would receive compensation. The Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre distributed approximately 500 million baht (~$15 million U.S.) to 422 relatives of victims (The Nation [Thailand], 2012). Notably, families of security personnel were also compensated, although the number of security personnel killed was much lower than that of the civilians.

149,Timor-Leste,860,Urgent Reparations Scheme under the CAVR,Urgent Reparations Scheme under the CAVR,Programme de réparations urgentes dans le cadre de la CAVR,1974-1999,"An Urgent Reparations Program was implemented to support individuals deemed especially vulnerable, whose needs were urgent and directly connected to human rights abuses that occurred between 1974 and 1999. Most recipients were survivors of torture or sexual violence, or individuals who had lost loved ones through enforced disappearances or killings. Many of those assisted were widows, orphans, people living with disabilities, or individuals facing social exclusion within their communities. The assistance provided under this initiative was limited in scope, consisting mainly of essential medical and psychological support, mobility aids for persons with disabilities, and a one-time emergency payment of $200. Funding for this program came from the Trust Fund for East Timor, managed by the World Bank. A total of 712 individuals benefited—516 men and 196 women. Given the Truth Commission’s emphasis on addressing gender-based violence, the disproportionate number of male recipients is notable. One likely reason is that fewer women came forward to provide testimony to the Commission, despite its efforts to employ female staff and adopt gender-sensitive approaches. Importantly, the Truth Commission stressed that this emergency program was intended only as a short-term solution and did not replace the State’s broader obligation to offer comprehensive reparations. The measure was never meant to represent full restitution or to relieve the government of its responsibilities to victims of past human rights violations.",International process; truth commission,,,,2003,,2003,,2005,,,compensation,,0,0,1,1,330,0,1,list of victims in the truth commission or recognized truth process,712,don't know,don't know,,,,foreign donor,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,,0,yes,yes,,no,1,"physical (death, bodily injury, temporary or long-term disability, etc. resulting from violations); mental/emotional (psychological or mental health challenge or condition resulting from violations)",yes,compensation (monetary compensation for any economically assessable damage),relatives of victims; victims,no,,,no,no,don't know,,1,712,712,"USD$142,200",no,,,,2025-07-22

Article 39 tasks the TDC with developing “a comprehensive individual and collective program for reparations for victims of violations.” The violations covered are expansive: any State violation between 1955 (when the French colonizers left) and 2013 (when the TDC was established) is potentially eligible for reparations. The definition of “victim” is extremely broad: “any individual, group or legal entity having suffered harm as a result of a violation” (Organic Law 53). The TDC final report, released in May 2019, contains a detailed individual reparations policy. It also contains detailed policy recommendations to the State in lieu of a collective reparations policy (see more below). The TDC aimed to provide material and moral reparation to individuals. Within individual reparations, there are 4 categories of financial compensation. Category 1 compensates for violations of victims’ right to life, including death, death under torture or resulting from torture, and forced disappearances. Category 1 has the highest compensation rates (100%=2,000 Tunisian Dinars). Category 2 compensates for violations of physical or psychological integrity, including “rape, torture, injuries during protests that led to a permanent partial disability, sexual violence, and forms of inhuman, degrading or harsh treatment and punishments” (TDC report, 424). These victims receive different levels of compensation: rape (70%), torture and injury (60%), sexual violence (35%), inhuman treatment (25%). Category 3 compensates for violations affecting the right to liberty and security of person, including prosecution, deprivation from resources, and arbitrary surveillance. These victims receive 40% compensation. Category 3 also includes illegal or arbitrary arrests, which are compensated depending on the amount of time spent in prison. Category 4 compensates violations of civil, political, economic, and social rights, including violation of the right to freedom of worship and right to education. Victims receive 15% compensation. In the case of a deceased victim, “spouses, children, fathers and mothers of victims will benefit from compensations in varying proportions, taking into consideration the specific situation of women, children and those with special needs” (TDC report, 426). Women and children who are relatives of a deceased victim will receive 5% more in compensation than male relatives (see p 427 for percentages). Individual reparations also include rehabilitation (free medical care in public health institutions) and restitution (restoring individuals who lost their jobs to their former, or comparable, employment). Collective reparations suggested in the TDC report aimed to address the root causes of the violations. The TDC recommends over 100 policy recommendations to protect rights to life, liberty, safety; ensure freedom from torture and sexual violence; achieve justice through fair trials; restore civil and political rights; ensure freedom of movement and residence; protect the right to freedom of assembly; improve access to affordable healthcare and education; improve access to jobs; protect minority rights; and fight against racial discrimination. A unique form of collective reparation is reparation for what the TDC calls victim regions, those which have been marginalized and excluded by the State. The TDC makes about 70 recommendations for improving the economic, social, cultural, and environmental development of these victim regions, among other things.

The law sets up Damage Assessment Commissions, one in each province, to receive applications and determine the amount and terms of compensation. Human Rights Watch has raised concerns about the fairness of the law, claiming that applicants have not been compensated in a timely manner and that their compensation was often not proportional to the damages they suffered.

The law also provides for an outreach program to notify those who may be eligible to receive compensation.
