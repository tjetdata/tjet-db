72,660,0,International Independent Investigation Commission Established Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1595 (2005),International Independent Investigation Commission Established Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1595 (2005),"The International Independent Investigation Commission Established Pursuant to Security Council was created by the UN Security Council (UNSC) on April 7, 2005 to look into the assassination of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri and 22 other people on February 14, 2005. The assassination has been called a terrorist attack. This investigative commission was established through Security Council resolution 1595 after the Lebanese government approved the UNSC's decision to do so. To not infringe on Lebanon's independence, the UN will assist the authorities in Lebanon in conducting the investigation of the terrorist act and to identity the culprits. The cooperation between the Lebanese government and the UN, and their tasks has been signed through the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). In regards to search and raid operations, the judicial system and security authority in Lebanon largely supports the commission. The MOU also gave the commission an 8,000-page document containing all the information relevant to the crime. Detlev Mehlis heads the commission and started the investigation in a temporary headquarter in Beirut on June 16, 2005. The commission had 30 investigators, who came from 17 different countries. According to the report, ""Given a deep mistrust that has prevailed among the Lebanese people towards their security and judicial authorities, UNIIIC has become a source of great expectation and hope for change"" for the Lebanese people (2005 Commission's Report 3). As a result, as the commission's operations progress, more and more witnesses came forward though these people asked that their identity remain anonymous. From June 16-October 6, 2005, the commission issued 244 witness statements, 293 investigator's notes, and 22 suspect statements. The commission also investigated 453 crime sites and produced 16,711 pages of documents. The commission's report concluded that the terrorist attack was done by ""a group with an extensive organization and considerable resources and capabilities"" (2005 Commission's Report 52). The commission's investigation lasted less than a year and the first report was delivered by Mehlis on October 19, 2005. The commission's mandate ended on February 28, 2009 and was replaced by the establishment of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), which aims to prosecute the same crime the commission investigated.",international,international law,the UN Security Council,,,2005,2005-04-07,,completed,0,2005,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,,2005 - 2008,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,61,,,,1,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,224,,,,,,,,2009,Yes,the United Nations,Yes,,,,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,There was no final report but interim reports.

218,850,0,Aceh Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Aceh Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"The Helsinki peace accord (2005), signed in the wake of the tsunami, contained the promise for a truth commission, as part of Indonesia’s national truth and reconciliation process. When the Constitutional Court struck down Indonesia’s truth commission law, the Aceh truth commission was left in legal limbo. As survivors and civil society in Aceh continued to push for their right to truth, the Commission was established by a local law (called Qanun, an Arabic word for ‘canon’ or law) passed by the Aceh parliament in 2013, called Qanun No. 17 of 2013 on the Aceh Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The commission does not have the power to compel testimonies or evidence from persons or organizations outside of Aceh. The localized truth-seeking process is designed with the main goal to document victim’s experiences, and make recommendations to assist. The Aceh TRC is mandated to look at violations committed by all sides of the conflict but its proximity to victims means that it must find a pathway to provide urgent assistance and reparations for vulnerable victims, with an emphasis on victims of torture, sexual violence and those disabled.

179,732,0,Presidential Truth Commission on Suspicious Deaths,Presidential Truth Commission on Suspicious Deaths,"Korea has a complicated contemporary history fraught with external invasion and intervention and, internal violence, and war. Imperial Japan invaded Korea in 1910 after years of war, terror, and political manipulation. When Japan surrendered to the Allies in WWII, the 35-year Japanese occupation came to an end. The division at the 38th parallel marked Soviet-controlled North Korea and US-controlled South Korea. The United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGK) aimed to hold South Korean elections by 1948. However, many interest groups who had been active in the Korean independence movement opposed elections because they were uncomfortable with external forces permanently dividing the Korean Republic. These interest groups conducted mass demonstrations, resulting in police brutality, which ultimately fomented uprising, notably on Jeju Island. President Sygman Rhee was elected in 1948 and ordered the Southern Republic of Korea (ROK) forces to crush the uprising with support from the US Military and several right-wing citizen paramilitaries. Together, they committed mass atrocities on Jeju Island, Suncheon and Yeosu, massacring and burning villages. By the early 1950s, At the ROK had consolidated a monopoly on violence in the South, but the Northern Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) still claimed sovereignty over the South—reciprocally, the ROK also claimed sovereignty over the North. Effectively, both thought of Korea as a unified territory, but could not reach a negotiated settlement for unification. In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, precipitating the Korean War, widely agreed to have been a proxy war of the US-Soviet Cold War. When the DPRK forces first attacked, President Rhee mercilessly executed communist sympathizers and opposition forces. Both sides committed atrocities on civilian victims. After the 3-year war, Rhee continued repression with martial law and autocratic rule, leading to the April Revolution, a student movement that ended Rhee’s regime in 1960. A brief democratic government failed to consolidate power, and its purges of anti-democratic military and police led to a military coup led by Major General Park in 1961. In 1963, Park orchestrated and won elections. In 1969, Park abolished his term limit. He violently repressed opposition, intellectuals, and religion through the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA). In 1979, mass demonstrations led to Park’s assassination, leading to another coup by Major General Chun. Chun generally continued the status quo of repression, notably in the Gwangju Massacre, but he retained some popularity with gradual social, economic, and political liberalization. In 1987, opposition parties gained enough political traction to force regime change, enacting a new constitution and democratic rule. Throughout the 1990s, pressure for truth-seeking and justice escalated, culminating in the non-stop sit-in in front of the National Assembly by the Korea Association of Bereaved Families for Democracy. This group was responsible for political will that led to the Special Act for Truth-Finding Suspicious Deaths No. 6170, which created the Presidential Truth Commission on Suspicious Deaths. The TCSD was mandated to investigate only those deaths that were directly related to the pro-democracy movement and only after Park became a formal authoritarian in 1969. This meant both that the TCSD could not investigate generalized human rights violations during the period and that it could not investigate deaths that were collateral damage to the pro-democracy movement. This limited the characteristics of victims to certain “ideal victims” like student activists and protestors, not victims who died due to the generalized violence of period. The TCSD had deceivingly slim powers; although the Special Act granted it the powers to compel testimony and documents through “orders of accompanying”, this was not backed by any threat of force and thus their orders of accompanying were essentially ignored. While administrative fines could be imposed on recalcitrant individuals, they could only be imposed in cases where the individual lacked “just cause” and by bureaucratic officers, who were recalcitrant themselves to cooperate with the TCSD. Since the Special Act does not define “just cause,” it was interpreted broadly. Kuk Cho notes that “In this sense, the activities of the Truth Commission were so limited that it had difficulty discovering the truth surrounding suspicious deaths without the voluntary cooperation of relevant persons and state authorities… state authorities were reluctant to cooperate with the investigation of the Truth Commission for fear that their own misconduct would be uncovered.” Hun Joon Kim writes that “During its first term, it issued eleven warrants, including two for former presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo. However, as the commission had no strong enforcement tools, none of the eleven warrants was carried out. For their refusal to cooperate, former presidents Chun and Roh were fined 10 million won (8,800 USD) and 7 million won (5,800 USD), respectively.” The TCSD was initially limited to 6 months with the possibility of a 3-month extension, but it was extended in November 2002 for a four-year total tenure, broken into a first term (2000-2002) and second term (2002-2004). It received 80 petitions and discovered 5 additional cases. 52 were attributed to the state, 30 lacked evidence and remained unsolved, and 3 were dismissed. In its first term, the TCSD took 6,536 testimonies, and in its second term, another 3,560. A few high-profile cases included victims killed under “protected custody,” a professor killed during interrogation by the KCIA, and North Korean spies killed in prison. When it was dissolved in 2004, it left a considerable number of unsolved mysteries. Nonetheless, it made some significant conclusions. It attributed responsibility to the state and a few perpetrators, whose names were handed to the public prosecutor’s office. The TCSD also found two key causes of the suspicious deaths, namely, that “state power was misused to protect and prolong the regime,” and that the state security forces “not only failed to fulfill their mission, but also acquiesced in government abuses and were even involved in concealing, distorting, and manipulating the truth.” It made several recommendations, divided roughly into individual and collective reparations, memorialization, security sector reforms and legal reforms including abolishing the statute of limitations on human rights crimes, enforcing punishment for perjury, and reforming the criminal justice and public prosecution system.",domestic,domestic law,President Kim Dae Jung,,,2000,2000-01-15,"excerpts available as an appendix here: <https://books.google.com/books?id=CWpuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA531&lpg=PA531&dq=Special+Act+to+Reveal+the+Truth+regarding+Suspicious+Deaths+Act+No.+6170,+Jan.+15,+2000&source=bl&ots=lgxpHLh9kq&sig=ACfU3U1ITq4xUjobkCK_AWQL6IMxFDZh-g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjymPmejrD5AhVDVTUKHXMLDdUQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=Special%20Act%20to%20Reveal%20the%20Truth%20regarding%20Suspicious%20Deaths%20Act%20No.%206170%2C%20Jan.%2015%2C%202000&f=false>",completed,0,2000,"<https://digitalcommons.law.uw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1439&context=wilj> <https://books.google.com/books?id=CWpuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA531&lpg=PA531&dq=Special+Act+to+Reveal+the+Truth+regarding+Suspicious+Deaths+Act+No.+6170,+Jan.+15,+2000&source=bl&ots=lgxpHLh9kq&sig=ACfU3U1ITq4xUjobkCK_AWQL6IMxFDZh-g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjymPmejrD5AhVDVTUKHXMLDdUQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=Special%20Act%20to%20Reveal%20the%20Truth%20regarding%20Suspicious%20Deaths%20Act%20No.%206170%2C%20Jan.%2015%2C%202000&f=false> <https://www.usip.org/publications/2000/10/truth-commission-south-korea-2000>",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"after August 7, 1969",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,52,"<https://digitalcommons.law.uw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1439&context=wilj> <https://books.google.com/books?id=CWpuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA531&lpg=PA531&dq=Special+Act+to+Reveal+the+Truth+regarding+Suspicious+Deaths+Act+No.+6170,+Jan.+15,+2000&source=bl&ots=lgxpHLh9kq&sig=ACfU3U1ITq4xUjobkCK_AWQL6IMxFDZh-g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjymPmejrD5AhVDVTUKHXMLDdUQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=Special%20Act%20to%20Reveal%20the%20Truth%20regarding%20Suspicious%20Deaths%20Act%20No.%206170%2C%20Jan.%2015%2C%202000&f=false> <https://www.usip.org/publications/2000/10/truth-commission-south-korea-2000>",fully independent,Yes,9,"According to Hun Joon Kim, they were, “nominated by the president with the consent of the National Assembly” among legal scholars and leaders in other pertinent fields.

132,490,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Commission Verité et Réconciliation (Truth and Reconciliation Commission),"The Democratic Republic of Congo gained its independence from Belgium in 1960, leaving a power vacuum of political violence as interest groups vyed for power. A secessionist war in the province of Katanga compounded Cold War proxy conflict, resulting in the deaths of some 100,000 people between 1960-66. In 1965, Colonel Mobutu Sese Seko took power, stablishing a rentier state wherein the military and political elites plundered the natural wealth of the DRC (then Zaire) for 32 years. During this time, Tutsi-Hutu conflict in Rwanda spilled over into Eastern Zaire, where Hutu militants carried out strikes against Rwandan Tutsis, prompting Rwandan, Ugandan, and Angolan invasion in the First Congo War. In 1997, Laurent Kabila partnered with the Rwandan Tutsi government and overthrew Mobutu. Then, Kabila began purging Tutsis from the DRC government. Congolese Tustis fought back with Rwandan, Ugandan, and Burundian troops, fomenting the Second Congo War until Kabila was assassinated in 2001. His son, Joseph Kabila, then took control of the DRC and attempted to negotiate peace through the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in December 2002, ushering in a transitional government in 2003. Contained in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the 2003 Transitional Constitution is the framework for a Truth Commission as one of five institutions “supporting the democracy.” Largely the result of lobbying from civil society groups, non-governmental organizations, and the UN Mission to the Congo (MONUC), the TRC was envisioned with a broad mandate to investigate the DRC’s entire history of human rights violations since independence from Belgium. The 2003 Constitution states that the TRC’s will be more explicitly defined by an organic law, but it was not until July 30, 2004 that Organic Law No. 04/018 was enacted, despite the fact that the TRC had been operating since 2003. Even as the TRC received its mandate and continued its operations, conflict-related deaths, disappearances, torture, and sexual violence continued. This compromised the security of the TRC and the integrity of the commissioners, who were still entangled with the narratives and violence of their respective sociopolitical groups. Thus, the TRC accomplished essentially none of its mandate and made limited, unimplemented recommendations. Its final report, submitted to parliament in February 2007, is confidential and unavailable for public review. The TRC was granted an exceedingly wide topical mandate, with jurisdiction over all human rights violations committed in or related to the conflicts in the DRC first, 1960-1992, about which some files already exist, and second, 1962-end of transition (undefined end date). It was empowered with semi-judicial powers; it could attribute legal responsibility to perpetrators of human rights violations, conduct legally binding adjudication between parties, and order benefits to parties based on the merits of their investigations of perpetrator liability. Additionally, it could request the services of the Public Prosecutor to carry out searches and seizures to obtain evidence as part of its investigations. However, it could not subpoena or compel testimony. Unfortunately, the TRC made use of almost none of the powers with which it was endowed. This is largely due to the lack of independence and integrity of the TRC. The reality of the situation in the DRC is such that after lifetimes of conflict, no individual is fully neutral or independent from their sociopolitical group, especially as conflict continues. While formally independent, the commissioners of the TRC were appointed by parties to the Inter-Congolese Dialogue, an inherently political organization. There were reports that some of the commissioners had previously committed human rights abuses. Even those commissioners who were supposed to be elected according to Law No. 04/018 were appointed due to the infeasibility of conducting secure elections in the provinces. This lack of everyday security penetrated the TRC with the significant worry that naming perpetrators and taking legal action against them would result in retaliation from those perpetrators’ sociopolitical groups. This concern prompted commissioners to “go easy” on perpetrators and fail to recommend important cases to the judiciary, thus placing their own security ahead of the TRC’s mandate. The insecurity and lack of independence resulted in a TRC that was fundamentally incapable of carrying out its primary function of truth-seeking. The TRC ultimately took no testimonies (except for those written complaints that were sent in to the TRC), held no hearings, named no victim or perpetrator names, and did not even make an estimate as to the number of victims. Some recommendations were made, largely for an extensive public outreach and awareness campaign in anticipation of the 2006 elections, that inter-militant and inter-ethnic peace continue to be pursued, and that the international community be more supportive of future transitional justice mechanisms, implicitly proposing that the TRC be renewed and improved after real democratic transition. Academic third-parties have echoed this implied proposal, claiming that the TRC was doomed from the start because the depth to which conflict had penetrated Congolese society meant that mid-conflict was simply not the right time for a TRC to investigate a half-century of related, incredibly personally meaningful conflicts. However, a positive outcome of the TRC was that more than 400 cases were referred to and investigated by the Office of the National Director of Public Prosecutions. Additionally, several ICC cases against former DRC state officials for war crimes resulted in international convictions.",domestic,peace agreement,,,,2002,2002-12-17,<https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CD_021216_Global%20and%20Inclusive%20Agreement%20on%20Transition%20in%20DRC.pdf>,completed,0,2003,<http://www.leganet.cd/Legislation/DroitPenal/Loi01.18.30.07.2004.CVR.htm>,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,"1960-“end of transition period,” which remains undefined but was understood as the 2006 elections",1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,3500000,<http://www.leganet.cd/Legislation/DroitPenal/Loi01.18.30.07.2004.CVR.htm>,don't know,Yes,21,"? Organic Law No. 04/018 specifies the qualifications for the Commissioners, notably that they are well-educated, have some sort of background in the “principles of truth and reconciliation,” do not hold any position of responsibility in a political party, can produce a “clean criminal record, a certificate of good conduct and morals, as well as a certificate of nationality,” and have never themselves been involved in crimes or violations of human rights. Further, if they meet these qualifications (and more), they must be ratified by parliament and take an oath of honor and impartiality.

191,860,0,United Nations Independent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-Leste,United Nations Independent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-Leste (UNISCOITL),"East Timor remained a Portuguese colony until the fall of its military dictatorship in 1974 to a popular movement for democracy. After a small civil war due to political instability in the power vacuum left by the Portuguese, East Timor declared its independence. However, as it became increasingly apparent that the Timor government would be left-leaning, Indonesia, influenced by the Cold War politics of the decade, inaugurated Operation Komodo, which aimed to integrate East Timor into the Indonesian territory. Indonesia began with a propaganda campaign, but as it faced backlash and rejection, conflict developed into a full-on invasion, including militarized attacks against border security, naval attempts against large cities, and take-overs of small villages. Unsurprisingly, this was accompanied by deprivation of civilian rights and intentional violation of civilians as a weapon. While the UN condemned the invasion, no further action was taken due to tacit support from the US, who viewed the invasion as in furtherance of containment. Indonesia occupied East Timor December 1975-October 1999. During this period, Indonesia subjected pro-independence opposition to systematic torture, sexual slavery, extrajudicial killing, arbitrary detention, and intentional starvation. The Commission for Reception, Truth, and Reconciliation in East Timor (CAVR) estimates that 90,800 to 202,600 Timor people died out of a population of approximately 823,386. Several pro-independence paramilitaries (CNRT) kept the independence movement strong while simultaneously exacerbating the Indonesian’s justification for repression. In 1999, after the end of the Cold War, Indonesia bowed to internal and external political pressures and organized a referendum for independence. Despite this seemingly victorious moment, anti-independence paramilitaries undertook a final wave of violence, destroying most of the country’s infrastructure until Australia intervened, and the UN Security Council established the UN Transitional Administration (UNATET). UNTAET was a rare peacekeeping mission in which the UN directly administered the territory of East Timor to secure order, relief assistance, rehabilitate physical infrastructure, and draft a constitution in the absence of any Timorese law. In 2002, Timor-Leste officially became fully self-governing. Today, the actions of Indonesia in Timor-Leste are widely considered genocide. In 2001, UNTAET established CAVR, which operated until 2005 with a view to establish the truth, promote reconciliation, attribute responsibility, and recommend institutional reforms for future peace and non-recurrence. CAVR was productive and successful, but few of its recommendations were implemented, allowing poverty, employment, and trauma to reinforce deep social cleavages, leading to violence in 2006. In January 2006, members of Timor-Leste’s armed forces wrote to President Xanana Gusmão complaining of mismanagement and discrimination by western groups. President Gusmão failed to take action, prompting over 400 soldier-petitioners to abandon their post, leading to the dismissal of 594 soldiers. These soldier-petitioners began protesting, ultimately attacking the Government Palace and destroying civilian property elsewhere in Dili. The government called out the police (PNTL) to control the protests, but this only exacerbated violence as the two armed groups clashed. Inspired by the clashes, another group of western armed forces abandoned their posts, joining the violence against the eastern armed forces and the PNTL. It was revealed that the Interior Minister had distributed weapons to civilians to support the PNTL, contributing to mass clashes of eastern and western gangs including and in defense of each region’s respective armed forces group. Prime Minister Alkatiri was also implicated in the violence—he allegedly had ordered the Interior Minister to distribute the weapons and hit squads to target political opponents. In the context of this crisis, several Timorese ministers wrote to the Secretary-General inviting them to establish an international inquiry. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 1690 affirming this request and referring it to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which established the United Nations Independent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-Leste (UNISCOITL). Its terms of reference were to determine the factual events of April and May 2006 and address the “loss of life, injury and widespread property damage,” and the “dysfunctions” of the security sector during this period. Hence, this COI is not a post-civil war TC, but rather a post-atrocity TC dealing with civil violence as a continuation of cleavages foundational to and arising from the prior civil war. As an international commission, it operated from Geneva. It visited Timor-Leste only twice, once in August and once in September 2006. During these visits, it heard 200 witnesses, including a few state agents that it names as primarily responsible perpetrators. Its most proficient method of inquiry, however, was by reviewing 2,000 official state archives and documents from the Prosecutor General of Timor–Leste, the Armed Forces, the PNTL, the Ministries, other United Nations bodies, other law enforcement agencies present in Timor-Leste (Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal), and NGOs. Although the UNISCOITL lacked the coercive powers of subpoena, summons, search and seizure, its “terms of reference make clear that the Commission would enjoy the full cooperation of the Government of Timor-Leste and would be provided with the necessary facilities to enable it to discharge its mandate.” Hence, these documents were readily provided. It produced its final report after only three months, in October 2006. It found that the violence resulted in 38 deaths, 69 injuries, and 150,000 displaced—IDP camp populations increased 300% in 24 hours, 15% of children in the IDP camps needed immediate attention for malnutrition, 57% of citizens lost their primary income, and 1,650 houses were destroyed. It attributed primary responsibility to the PNTL General Commander, Chief of Defence Forces, Interior Minister, and Prime Minister. It found no evidence that Prime Minister Alkatili ordered the distribution of weapons or hit squad targets, but it supported the suspicion “that the former Prime Minister at least had knowledge about the distribution of PNTL weapons to civilians.” It stated that President Gusmão also exacerbated and promoted violence with an inflammatory speech. The final report makes recommendations, including the prosecution of about 100 named, low-level perpetrators, judicial reforms, international oversight and involvement in the judicial system, and security sector reforms.",international,international law,,UN Security Council,,2006,2006-06-20,"<http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/1690>, terms of reference included on page 11 of <https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Countries/COITimorLeste.pdf>",completed,0,2006,,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,,,0,1,1,Yes,April and May 2006,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,151107,,fully independent,Yes,3,"They were “appointed by the Secretary-General upon the recommendation of the High Commissioner for Human Rights based on their expertise, integrity, and independence.

183,780,0,Commission of Inquiry into the Involuntary Removal or Disappearances of Persons in the Northern & Eastern Provinces (North Eastern),Commission of Inquiry into the Involuntary Removal or Disappearance of Persons in the Northern and Eastern Provinces,"For most of its contemporary history, Sri Lanka has experienced ethnic competition between its two predominant groups, Hindu Tamils and Buddhist Sinhalese. Oscillating ethnicities of prime ministers and cabinets after independence from the British in 1948 led to each administration enacting discriminatory legislation against the other ethnicity in an attempt to consolidate an ethnic monopoly on political power. This resulted in the Sinhala Only Act, which made Sinhala the official language, a symbolic act of Sinhalese majority oppression of the Tamil minority. Through the 1950s, successive presidents attempted to unite the country and put an end to ethnic grievances, but to no success. The manipulation of these grievances in electoral politics in the 1960s led to two problems: first, a youth crisis, which produced the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), and second, a growing militant sentiment among the Tamil in the North during the 1970s. The JVP, a Marxist-Leninist militant organization, staged an unsuccessful coup in 1971. In 1975, Tamil militants assassinated a local Sinhalese mayor, and in 1976, the ad hoc Tamil guerilla forces consolidated into the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Beginning in 1983, Tamil clashed with government security forces, resulting in race riots and increased organizational capacity—the LTTE received arms, food, and training from India (Tamils and India share Hindu nationalism) as it attempted to establish its own independent state. This is the official beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War, which would not end until 2009. In 1987, the Sri Lankan government and Indian government signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, which made significant concessions to Tamils, including the devolution of state authority and an open door for their future independence, but also authorized the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) to neutralize the LTTE. Exploiting this distraction and the widespread anti-Indian Sinhalese sentiment angry with the government for making concessions, the JVP launched a second insurrection. The LTTE-Indian violence and the Sri Lankan government-JVP violence caused widespread chaos, guerilla tactics, targeting civilian victims, and suicide bombs. The government response included widespread killings and “disappearances” of suspected insurgents. The government won a decisive military victory against the JVP by 1990. In a desperate hope for peaceful negotiated settlement, President Ranasinghe Premadasa ordered the IPKF to leave in 1990 and opened negotiations with the LTTE. Violence only increased, although it was more contained—the LTTE expelled the Sri Lankan Muslims in an act of ethnic cleansing. By the late 1990s, negotiations had begun. In 2002, the LTTE and Sri Lanka signed a ceasefire brokered by Norway. Violence continued until 2009. In 1995, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga created three “zonal” Commissions of Inquiry into the Involuntary Removal or Disappearance of Persons—one for the Central, North West, North Central and Uva Provinces, one for the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and one for the Western, Southern, and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. They all completed work in 1997, when President Kumaratunga created an “All Island” COI to synthesize their work and fill in remaining gaps. The “zonal” COI for the Northern and Eastern Provinces was created by a Proclamation in Gazette 855/19 published on January 25, 1995, although the COI’s final report states that it was signed November 30, 1994. The COI was composed of three commissioners, Chaired by Krishnapillai Palakidner Esquire. It only had four months to complete its investigations. It had a topic-specific mandate limiting the scope of inquiry to disappearances and arbitrary detentions, and it had limited powers, with no power to compel. The ongoing civil war put the COI in extreme insecurity, forcing it to cancel or postpone several public hearings. Ultimately, these delays and challenges prevented the COI from completing its investigation into and hearing of some Army officers. The COI was contained within the Ministry of Justice in Colombo but conducted public hearings in regions across the island. Its exact number of victims and testimony is unclear because the COI does not list numbers for several of the regions in which it received complaints and heard testimony from the complainants. For those for which it does provide numbers, the number of complaints (roughly equivalent to the number of victims) is 2,489. Summons were issued to each of the complainants. Due to logistical constraints that prevented the COI from holding its public hearings or due to complainant’s lack of response to repeated summons, the number of testimonies heard totals 1,960. Its final report concludes “that youth in the north and east disappeared in droves in the latter part of 1989 and during the latter part of 1990.” It repeatedly condemns the state security forces, stating that “90% of the removal was ascribed to the security forces—Army, Navy, Airforce and the Police. LTTE also was responsible for its own share of removals. Other militant groups also are in the picture.” The report names 12 officers for prosecution, and notes that there are probably thousands of other individually responsible officers—it was nearly impossible for the COI to name any names because Sri Lankan police and military do not wear name tags or even badges indicating to which institution they belong, so victims or their families have almost no information about their or their relatives’ captors. Those perpetrators that testified were not forthcoming, so the COI also faced a “blank wall” in determining the whereabouts of those disappeared.",domestic,domestic law,Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,,,1995,1995-01-25,,completed,0,1995,,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,yes,yes,0,1,1,Yes,“anytime after January 1988”,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,2489,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-19.pdf>,partially independent,Yes,3,"Named in the Proclamation, i.e. appointed by President Kumaratunga",No,Yes,4,,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-19.pdf>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-19.pdf>,Yes,1960,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-19.pdf,1997,Yes,The COI published its own report.,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,1,"Captain Suresh Cassim, Major Suraweera, Dean of Dyke Road, Trincomalee, Richard Peiris of Trincomalee police, Captain Munaz, Captain Palitha, Capt.

207,150,0,Truth and Justice Commission,"Truth and Justice Commission (Comisión Verdad y Justicia, CVJ)","The decades leading up to Alfredo Stroessner's dictatorship were colored by political instability, a civil war, and a war with Bolivia. Stroessner took power in Paraguay from his military, adding to the long history of military rule. Under Stroessner’s 34-year rule, political freedom was limited, dissent was suppressed, the indigenous were assimilated, and the language of the native people was banned from education. The country found itself increasingly isolated from the international community. In February 1989, General André Rodriguez ousted Stroessner from power, and later won the Paraguayan presidential election. Steps towards stability were taken, including the adoption of a new constitution. Paraguay returned to a civil government in 1993, but political infighting overshadowed the need to address abuses of the past. Interest in creating a truth commission heightened when Dr. Martin Almada, a Paraguayan lawyer and human rights activist, accidentally uncovered tons of intelligence documents that exposed the role of Paraguayan security forces in “Operation Condór”. Operation Condór was a covert transnational military network that enabled Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, and later Peru and Ecuador to monitor, torture, “disappear” or execute political opponents across borders. The records discovered in Paraguay documented the secret establishment of the network in 1975, the existence of a joint information center at the headquarters of the Chilean secret police in Santiago as well as the involvement of General Stroessner in Operation Condor. The files discovered in Paraguay became known as the Archive of Terror.

126,155,0,"National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, also the Rettig Commission","Comisión Nacional de Verdad y Reconciliación o sea la Comisión Rettig (National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, also the Rettig Commission)","General Augusto Pinochet led a military coup against President Salvador Allende in September 1973 that marked the beginning of a nearly 30-year authoritarian military junta. Until 1981, Pinochet’s government was formally a military junta, but it met domestic and international demands to restore some illiberal semblance of civilian control in 1981, when Pinochet was declared President. In a number of fraudulent or rigged elections, Pinochet retained power until 1989, when Pinochet lost closely to Patricio Aylwin. The period from 1973-1990 in which Pinochet remained in power was marked by politically-motivated human rights violations, including illegal imprisonment, disappearances, assassinations, torture including sexual violence, and kidnappings. During this period of time, the military enjoyed full impunity due to their association with Pinochet and maintained that they were fighting an “internal war” to justify their widespread abuses of power. After Aylwin was elected, the military retained some political power in the judicial and legislative branches due to the incredibly undemocratic stipulations of the 1980 Constitution that was explicitly designed to maintain Pinochet’s power and guarantee Pinochet’s and his accessories’ amnesty. Hence, there was largely no justice for victims in the immediate aftermath of Pinochet’s fall from power. To facilitate eventual justice, Aylwin enacted Supreme Decree No. 355 in April 1990, which established la Comisión Nacional de Verdad y Reconciliación, which was also called the ‘Rettig Commission’ after its President, Raúl Rettig, a former Chilean senator and ambassador. The TRC’s mandate and powers were relatively restricted. While it was empowered to investigate all killings, disappearances, kidnappings, tortures, and illegal detainments, it is very important to note that its mandate only included those human rights violations that resulted in death. Thus, the TRC excluded a large number of violations that did not result in death and was forced to throw out several hundred cases that consisted of human rights violations but were not covered under its mandate. Additionally, Supreme Decree No. 355 specifically and repeatedly restricts the TRC from taking any prosecutorial action or affecting legal proceedings. It emphasizes that the TRC is an executive body and the judiciary has exclusive responsibility to establish what crimes have been committed. In this vein, the TRC had no powers to summon or subpoena. Largely, the TRC served a fact-finding mission for the purpose of memorialization, reconciliation, and symbolic reparation. It heavily relied on the work and records of human rights organizations, professional organizations, such as labor unions, and political organizations, including parties. Consolidating these cases, the TRC initially investigated 3,428 cases, but only 2,279 of these were confirmed as crimes of political violence or human rights violations under the TRC’s mandate. The final report lists these victims’ names and the specific nature of their death, torture, detainment, disappearance, or otherwise to astounding specificity. Perpetrators’ names, however, were not published. There were stipulations made that perpetrators’ names would be published in 2016, but it is unclear whether this actually occurred. The Rettig report found that a majority of planned forced disappearances by the government happened between 1974 and August 1977. Specifically, the report indicated that the National Intelligence Directorate (DINA) was responsible for a large amount of repression during this time period. It also makes hundreds of well-detailed recommendations, mainly focused on legal, judicial, and constitutional reform in addition to some limited reparations. The report was circulated amongst TV broadcasters, daily newspapers, and universities for public dissemination and translation. The TRC’s largest success was stripping the military of its control over historical narrative. While officers’ dismissal was impossible, the favorable public reaction to the TRC’s report resulting in the military fundamentally reassess defending the period that they formerly distinguished as their crowning achievement. Aylwin took some of the TRC’s recommendations, including implementing memorialization efforts and reevaluating the constitution and some legislation in the context of compatibility with human rights. However, revising the Chilean constitution was largely impossible due to the 60% supermajority required for amendment, the concentration of power in the executive, and the many powers that the constitution granted to the military, including some seats in the legislature and participation in judicial proceedings. Aylwin further established the National Corporation for Reparation and Reconciliation, which furthered the TRC’s recommendations for two years after its charter ended. The NCRR removed the families of the disappeared from bureaucratic limbo by removing the requirement that family must be legally pronounced dead to receive reparations. Thus, about 5,000 families received about $5,000 annually. Again, the restricted mandate of the TRC excluded victims of torture and illegal imprisonment without death and thus these families, which were much more numerous, did not benefit from reparations. Finally, there was no prosecution or sanctions on Pinochet, but this would later change with Pinochet’s arrest in London in 1998 on a Spanish arrest warrant and eventual legal prosecution for crimes against humanity. Overall, the TRC made positive impacts on the Chilean collective consciousness, although it did not necessarily achieve reconciliation.",domestic,domestic law,President Patricio Aylwin,,,1990,1990-04-25,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Chile90-Charter.pdf>,completed,0,1990,<https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=30490&idVersion=2009-12-10&idParte=>,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"September 11, 1973 and March 11, 1990",1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,3428,<https://www.beyondintractability.org/casestudy/brahm-chilean>,fully independent,Yes,8,By merit; the commissioners are described in Decree No. 355 as “highly respected people with moral authority” and many had previous legal experience.,No,Yes,60,,,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,,Yes,,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,,1991,Yes,"The TRC itself, then the State Department and Ministry of Justice, then a daily newspaper",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,0,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,eliminate symbols that are “divisive for Chileans”,,No,,"Brahm, Eric. “The Chilean Truth and Reconciliation Commission.” Text.

171,517,0,"International Commission of Investigation on Human Rights Violations in Rwanda Since October 1, 1990","Commission internationale d’enquête sur les violations des droits de l’homme au Rwanda depuis le 1er Octobre 1990 (International Commission of Investigation on Human Rights Violations in Rwanda Since October 1, 1990)","Rwanda has a long history of ethnic conflict between minority Tutsis and majority Hutus. Due to Belgian colonizers’ active favoritism toward Tutsis and discrimination against Hutus, a post-independence Hutu counter-elite developed, demanding a transfer of power from Tutsis to Hutus. This Hutu elite militarized and conducted violent raids on Tutsi homes and purged the government of Tutsis, prompting a mass Tutsi exodus to neighboring Burundi, Uganda, and the former Zaire (DRC). In 1973, Hutu army officer Juvénal Habyarimana conducted a coup and founded the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) party, in which membership was mandatory, officially making Rwanda a one-party state. Meanwhile, the thousands of Tusti refugees in Uganda formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR), participating in the Ugandan Bush War and later becoming senior officers of the Ugandan Army. From this position, the FPR leaders orchestrated a mass recruitment scheme, free riding on the resources and training of the Ugandan Army to form an army for the invasion of Rwanda. In October 1990, the RPF rebels deserted their posts with the Ugandan Army and invaded Rwanda, fighting the Hutu-led Rwandan Armed Forces (AFR). The RPF continuously violated human rights, including by recruiting child soldiers, while the AFR retaliated against Tutsi civilian populations, orchestrating community-wide Tutsi massacres through local public officials. In July 1992, the RPF and AFR reached a ceasefire agreement, and in August 1993, the parties signed the Arusha Accords, a formal negotiated settlement presumed to be the end of the civil war. Before the signing of the Arusha Accords, in early 1993, numerous Rwandan civil society groups and the Council of Ministers demanded the establishment of a commission of inquiry. They formed a coalition (Comité de Liaison des Associations de Défense des Droits de l’Homme au Rwanda) and appealed to the international community for assistance with an investigation. Four international NGOs—the International Federation of Human Rights, Africa Watch, the Inter-African Union for Human Rights and the Rights of Peoples, and the International Center for the Rights of the Individual and the Development of Democracy—responded to this demand and created the non-official commission internationale d’enquête sur les violations des droits de l’homme au Rwanda depuis le 1er Octobre 1990 (International Commission of Investigation on Human Rights Violations in Rwanda Since October 1, 1990). On January 7, 1993, representatives of these four founding NGOs met and agreed on the COI’s mandate, with had a general fact-finding mission that emphasized recognizing victims and naming potential perpetrators. The NGOs appointed 10 commissioners—generally legal, forensic, and political scholars and human rights activists. The very next day, these commissioners traveled to Rwanda, where they spent two weeks visiting five of 11 prefectures, taking “several hundred” peoples’ testimony, documenting 2,000 deaths, and excavating caves in the Northwest allegedly used as mass graves, where they found evidence of human remains. The COI’s arrival and activities received mixed responses; President Habyarimana sent a letter to the commissioners welcoming them and pledging cooperation, and yet, the same day, sent another letter to the MRND suggesting that the COI was an interference in domestic affairs. There were certainly positives and negatives of not being formally associated with the government; while the commissioners did not have access to a great deal of documentation and were denied entry to some regions of the country, they did enjoy the utmost independence. The final report notes with suspicion a few attempts to compromise this independence, namely by the appointment of a solicitor-general, Alphonse-Marie Nkubito, to help guide the COI’s investigation. That said, the COI’s final report notes that, with few exceptions, the COI enjoyed the cooperation of government officials. It was accompanied by a soldier almost everywhere it went; it was escorted by the OAU to the neutral ground RPF camps to take rebel testimony; and it even took testimony from President Habyarimana, the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Interior, and the Minister of Defense. The content of this testimony is not available to the public, although most testimonies were given publicly. After two weeks in Rwanda, the commissioners retired to Brussels, citing a lack of resources and the increasing violence in Rwanda. In Brussels, they reviewed previous reports from international NGOs and civil society in preparation for their final report, published in March 1993. The report features entire sections dedicated to the massacres after invasion, IDPs, death squads, economic/employment impact of conflict, inhumane detention facilities, and the deterioration/complicity of the judicial system. The report states that local leaders, such as cell leaders and bourgemestres, are individually responsible for inciting spontaneous massacres, but claims that it is clear these local leaders have either been following orders from or have been encouraged by higher national-level authorities. In addition, the report recognizes society’s collective responsibility, noting that during the massacres, public figures such as teachers, civil service officers, etc. participated in and sustained violence. It concludes that there have been acts of genocide from both sides; that journalists are consistently harassed; that political militias are racketeering the country, contributing to a generalized climate of terror; that these political militias participate in organized rape; that both the FPR and AFR are guilty of human rights violations, and that the judicial system is paralyzed. It offers about twenty recommendations, largely for negotiations, security sector reforms, the decentralization of the government from under the President, a formal, state-empowered truth commission, and the international community to link development assistance to conditionality that requires human rights reforms. Notably, the day after the commissioners left Rwanda, the government massacred an estimated 300-500 people. One year after the submission of its final report, President Habyarimana was murdered in April 1994, initiating the cascade of violence that was the Rwandan genocide, the “final solution” to exterminate the Tutsi minority. To cope with this atrocity, Rwanda would later establish the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission.",hybrid,domestic law,Formed by mutual agreement of Rwandan civil society groups and the four international NGOs,,<https://www.usip.org/publications/1993/01/commission-inquiry-rwanda-93>,1993,1993-01-01,,completed,0,1993,<https://www.usip.org/publications/1993/01/commission-inquiry-rwanda-93>,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,,,0,1,1,Yes,"October 1, 1990 to early 1993",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,2000,,fully independent,Yes,10,Proposed and selected by the founding NGOs.,No,Yes,4,,<https://www.usip.org/publications/1993/01/commission-inquiry-rwanda-93>,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,Yes,,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,,1993,Yes,The founding NGOs published the report.,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,1,"Those responsible for human rights violations, including by continuing the investigation begun by the COI into those named in the report and into those mass gravesites discovered by the COI",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,"immediate negotiations; that President Habyarimana condemn all incitement of hate or violations of human rights, announce publicly that state agents responsible for human rights violations will be prosecuted; take measures to ensure the rehiring of all those laborers who have lost their jobs as a result of politically-motivated detention; link international development aid to conditionality requirements for respect for human rights, certain human rights reforms, and certain steps to bring an end to violence; end all military aid to belligerents; continue to push parties to pursue settlement",,No,,"United States Institute of Peace. “Commission of Inquiry: Rwanda 93.” Accessed March 24, 2022. https://www.usip.org/publications/1993/01/commission-inquiry-rwanda-93. “Report of the International Commission of Investigation on Human Rights Violations in Rwanda: Since October 1, 1990.” Human Rights Watch, March 1, 1993. https://www.hrw.org/report/1993/03/01/report-international-commission-investigation-human-rights-violations-rwanda.",1,establish independent human rights bodies,conducted outreach,general recommendation,current opposition; current state agents,,,don't know,responsibility; historial truth; restitution; reparation; recognition of victims; truth for victims,general recommendation,,foreign donor,,,general recommendation; discipline / changed codes of conduct; other,374,804,2024-01-25
130,437,0,Mediation Committee for National Reconciliation,Le Comité de Médiation pour la Réconciliation Nationale (Mediation Committee for National Reconciliation),"Côte d’Ivoire was divided along religious and ethnic lines in anticipation for the 2000 elections, in which Alassane Ouattara, a Muslim, announced his candidacy. In 1999, the military conducted a coup, led by General Guei, and promised to hold the 2000 elections. However, they barred Ouattara and other candidates from running on the basis of their ethnicity and parental nationalities. The Ouattara-led opposition boycotted the October 2000 elections, resulting in candidate Laurent Gbagbo’s lead. However, the military did not approve of Gbagbo and stopped the elections midway through counting, declaring General Guei as the winner. Within hours, Gbagbo and his armed forces had taken the city of Abidjan, resulting in violence and 171 deaths. When Gbagbo was declared president, Ouattara and the opposition also engaged in combat. In efforts to bring about peace and consolidate democracy, Gbagbo enacted Decree No. 2000-818 on 20 November 2000, creating le Comité de Médiation pour la Réconciliation Nationale (CMRN, Mediation Committee for National Reconciliation). In 2001, Gbagbo and Ouattara established a ceasefire in an effort at reconciliation, but violence continued due to fertility gaps in land that benefited the Ivorian Muslim population. The military mutinied, resulting in the First Ivorian Civil War (2002-2004). This forced the CMRN to dissolve despite having achieved limited results and produced no report. Decree No. 2000-818 states that the CMRN is to investigate “resentments and all other frustrations caused by the current socio-political context” since 24 December 1999, the date of the military coup by General Guei. It does not say anything about specific human rights violations. In statements to the Council of Ministers and the general public, Gbagbo stated that the CMRN was specifically focused on the post-election violence and future peace. However, the mandate did not enumerate any explicit powers to conduct meaningful investigations. That said, Gbagbo also emphasized that “reconciliation does not exclude justice and does not mean absence of prosecution for the perpetrators of offenses committed during these troubles.” But more than anything else, the CMRN was intended to conduct historical investigations as a “public square” in which Ivorians could “empty themselves” and stakeholder representatives could dialogue about the source(s) of social and ethnoreligious conflict. This was reflected in the composition of the CMRN, which was chaired by Ombudsman Mathieu Ekra. Ekra was empowered to appoint 27 other commissioners, including Muslim and Christian religious leaders and civil society. In this spirit, the CMRN hosted a Forum de la Réconciliation Nationale (National Reconciliation Forum) October to December 2001 to reduce tensions between Gbagbo and the Outtara-led opposition. At this Forum, Gbagbo and other political leaders acknowledged Outtara’s Ivorian nationality, and Outtara and other opposition leaders acknowledged the legitimacy of Gbagbo’s government, resulting in the ceasefire. This was a relative success, despite the ceasefire’s ultimate dissolution. The CMRN dissolved with the ceasefire in 2002 with the beginning of the Civil War.",domestic,domestic law,Laurent Gbagbo,,<https://www.usip.org/publications/2000/11/commission-inquiry-cote-divoire>,2000,2000-11-20,<https://www.juriafrica.com/lex/decret-2000-818-20-novembre-2000-33623.htm>,completed,0,2000,<https://www.usip.org/publications/2000/11/commission-inquiry-cote-divoire>,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,24 December 1999 - present,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,,<https://www.usip.org/publications/2000/11/commission-inquiry-cote-divoire> <https://www.cath.ch/newsf/cote-d-ivoire-le-president-forme-un-comite-de-reconciliation-avec-les-responsables-religieux/> <https://www.juriafrica.com/lex/decret-2000-818-20-novembre-2000-33623.htm>,partially independent,Yes,28,"According to the Decree No. 2000-818, the commissioners were appointed by the Chair, Ombudsman Ekra, who is referred to as the “Grand Mediator”.

He also installed the President’s Alternative Treatment Program, which cancelled HIV treatment across the Gambia, claiming that he found an herbal remedy to HIV demanding that those with HIV come under his personal care, where he drugged them with a fraudulent medicine that resulted in death or permanent internal damage. He treated infertility similarly. Further, Jammeh and the Junglers conducted “witch hunts” of “witch and wizard doctors” who were taken to detention centers, tortured with poisonous herbs, and often murdered. Jammeh was re-elected in 2001, 2006, and 2001 through a combination of fraud and intimidation, but lost the 2011 election due to overwhelming pro-democracy movements and international condemndation. Although Jammeh attempted to contest the result, he was forced from the presidency and into exile by neighboring states and the international community, allowing President Adama Barrow to peacefully come to power in 2016. Naturally, the Gambia was incredibly divided and traumatized by Jammeh’s regime. The National Assembly enacted the Truth, Reconciliation, and Reparation Commission Act on December 13, 2017, which was promulgated by President Barrow on January 13, 2018. The TRRC mandate was broad, with the mission to establish a historical narrative, facilitate coexistence and reconciliation, promote non-recurrence, and allocate reparations for the human rights violations and abuses July 1994 to January 2017. It had 11 commissioners, which included representatives of victims’ groups and had to be confirmed by victims’ groups prior to appointment. It also enjoyed considerable powers, including the powers to subpoena and summon witnesses. The TRRC’s outreach to civil society and victims’ groups was extensive; commissioners and staff not only traveled to sites across the country, but also conducted outreach activities including women’s group “listening circles”, village dialogues, awareness campaigns, and school reconciliation programs at 57 schools. All testimonies were public, unless confidentiality was specifically requested by the victim, all perpetrators’ names were public, and hearings were widely attended by the Gambian people, who generally approved of and praised the Commission. The Commission’s work with the HIV program and sexual abuse victims was unprecedented and uplifted by NGOs and the international community as a model for destigmatization and victim-centered sensitivity. At the same time, the TRRC was notably impartial towards perpetrators, who were considered for recommended amnesty should their abuses be minor enough that cooperation, remorse, and victim apology could facilitate reconciliation. The TRRC was not empowered to fully grant amnesty, it could only recommend it, but it took a considerable amount of perpetrator testimony. The TRRC submitted its 17-volume report to President Barrow in November 2021 and released it to the public in December 2021, after several delays. Overall, the TRRC took 338 formal testimonies and spoke to 50,000 Gambians informally at home and in the diaspora, made 418 findings and 218 recommendations, and recognized 240-250 victims. The report concludes that the peak of the killing occurred 2000-2010, during which time 150 people were killed, including 17 students, 66 West African migrants, journalist Deyda Hydara, 41 victims of Jammeh’s HIV treatment, 39 people killed during his witch-hunting exercise and people randomly killed by the Junglers. The report also found that the fraudulent HIV treatment endangered the lives of hundreds and resulted in health defects in many patients that persist to the present. The report also reflects on Jammeh’s consistent sexual violence, which it finds was used as an instrument of repression, torture, and punishment. Acts of sexual assault were often perpetrated by inferior military or Junglers on the orders of Jammeh or other senior officials. The TRRC demands that the government prosecute 70 named perpetrators, offering domestic, international, and hybrid judicial options. However, only a few of the perpetrators are in custody. The TRRC also set out a model for reparations and made institutional reform recommendations. According the TRRC Act, within 6 months of the completion of the report, the executive and legislative must issue a “white paper” proposed plan to carry out the recommendations. The proposal to incorporate the TRRC’s recommendations into law was released May 25, 2022. It includes a plan to prosecute Jammeh, officials, and the Junglers in addition to systems of social and economic support for victims. Victims’ groups, journalists, and international organizations seem optimistic that President Barrow will follow through with this proposal, especially given that the Justice Ministry has openly supported the plan.",domestic,domestic law,The national assembly and President Adam Barrow,,,2018,2018-01-13,<https://www.lawhubgambia.com/truth-reconciliation-reparations-commission>,completed,0,2018,<https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/11/25/gambia-truth-commission-calls-prosecuting-ex-officials> <https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a7c2ca18a02c7a46149331c/t/5a8451b4e4966bfad91329e9/1518621128178/truth%2C+reconcilation+and+reparations+commission+act%2C+2017.pdf>,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,no,no,1,1,1,Yes,July 1994-January 2017,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,250,<https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/86069-trrc-final-report-gambia-between-prosecutions-and-amnesties.html> <https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a7c2ca18a02c7a46149331c/t/5a8451b4e4966bfad91329e9/1518621128178/truth%2C+reconcilation+and+reparations+commission+act%2C+2017.pdf>,fully independent,Yes,11,"According to the TRRC Act, the commissioners had to be Gambian citizens with “high moral character and integrity who have distinguished themselves in their respective fields of vocation or communities.” They could not be actively involved in a political party, bankrupt, or a felon.

115,145,0,Truth Commission of the Plurinational State of Bolivia,la Comisión de la Verdad del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia (Truth Commission of the Plurinational State of Bolivia),"In 1982, the Comisión Nacional de Investigación de Ciudadanos Desaparecidos (CNICD) of Bolivia, suffered from limited powers and a lack of systematization, resulting in failure; in 1985, after 3 years of work, the CNICD was disbanded without having produced a final report. The lack of closure suffered by victims and their families resurfaced under the administration of President Evo Morales, prompting him to create a second truth commission in 2016 to investigate the same human rights violations during the same period of 1964-1982 as the CNICD. President Morales signed the Legislative Assembly Law No. 879 on December 23, 2016, creating a TC with a wider topical mandate and wider range of powers, including accessing formerly classified military, police, and other authorities’ confidential documents, compelling witness testimony, providing witness protection and confidentiality, and emphasizing that public and private individuals have a “duty to collaborate and facilitate” the TC’s work at the penalty of criminal or administrative legal action. Law No. 879 mandates that the TC’s report must be made public after its completion and disseminated to the media. 6,000 case files from the former CNICD were transferred to the TC when it began its work in 2017, and the TC also thanks the Association of Relatives of Missing Detainees and Martyrs for National Liberty (ASOFAMD) and the National Commission for Compensation for Victims of Political Violence (CONREVIP) for transferring files. The TC issued its report in March 2020, identifying 164 victims: 74 illegally arrested, 26 illegally detained whose remains were found, 39 missing, 19 detainees who disappeared to Argentina, and 6 detainees who disappeared to other Latin American countries. It discovered 21 places of detention, torture, mass graves, and burial sites of victims. Its other conclusions widely blame Operation Condor and the Cold War politics of the United States, with some highly political commentary. Such commentary included denouncing the business sector for condoning human rights violations because they enjoyed the market freedom granted by the dictatorships. The report also condemns the dictatorships’ military occupation of universities, censorship of curriculum, subjugation of the press, unions, the Church, and the military’s “consumption of women’s bodies as objects,” labeling the sexual assault performed by authorities as a form of torture. Hence, the report concludes that the state is in historical debt to victims and must adopt a comprehensive system of reparations and institutionalize education about human rights and the violations of the dictatorships in order to facilitate memorialization. To this point, the TC makes dozens of recommendations. They include initiating legal proceedings and summons to several specific, named perpetrators alleged to have committed specific murders; reform the public as well as police and military education systems; reform the penal code to reconsider the wording of the crime of torture and declare it a crime against humanity; ratify all UN human rights treaties; expand the system of reparations to include a specific medical and healthcare budget; create several independent governmental bodies, including an “Archive of Repression” to document missing persons and detainees; and encourage private memorialization through museums and research institutions. Despite its seemingly legitimate surface and profuse recommendations, the TC was widely criticized by the public, media, and academics for its lack of independence from the Morales administration and complete partiality and partisanship toward President Morales’ party, Movimiento Al Socialismo (MAS). Bolivian political analysts widely consider the TC not credible because every commissioner was a member of MAS and had a significant connection to Morales’ personal life. The commissioners faced widespread criticism due to low levels of public trust and high levels of suspicion that the TC and its commissioners were pawns in Morales’ public relations strategy to denounce foreign influence and uplift indigenous voices. For example, Commissioner Gironda was forced to resign from the TC in May 2018 due to his involvement with the scandal between Morales and his ex-girlfriend, Gabriela Zapata, who was convicted of corruption and alleged that Morales fathered her child. While this allegation was proven false (they did not have a child), amid the scandal Commissioner Gironda was alleged to possess the birth certificate the nonexistent child. Additionally, Commissioner Édgar “Huracán” Ramírez made a public declaration that he was not a part of the government’s objectives or strategies, prompting the media to publicize this declaration as a confirmation that he most definitely was a part of the government’s objectives or strategies. Finally, victims groups wrote a ranting letter to Commissioner Nila Heredia, who served as the chair of the TC, decrying her lack of interest in actually creating change and seeming willingness to protect the status quo of military impunity. However, military impunity continued even after the TC finished its work due to the TC’s failure to include declassified military documents or names of perpetrators in its report and due to the failure of the Bolivian government to enact the TC’s recommendations and/or prosecute perpetrators.",domestic,domestic law,"The Legislative Assembly, signed by President Evo Morales",,<http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/normas/buscar/879>,2016,2016-12-23,<http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/normas/buscar/879>,completed,0,2017,,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"November 4, 1964 to October 10, 1982",1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,164,<http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/normas/buscar/879>,not independent,Yes,5,"According to Law No. 879, “based on their proven impartiality, professional capacity, ethics and personal integrity, commitment to the promotion of human rights, as well as knowledge of the experienced reality during the period [1964-82].” The commissioners were designated by President Evo Morales.",Yes,Yes,,,<http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/normas/buscar/879> <http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2FPPRiCAqhKb7yhshq%2BGyE5%2BB75n79RS6jeVcVGayuJP9flmdAmnToVlqCALenfGy1rUykHeddHN6F55SNEP8iESP7kkvYITPOjr1ncw5wSh9d15ttAYG32%2FanIURuVUCFMqB37OXUbiqVkTA%3D%3D> <https://fundacionperiodismo.org/diplomado-politico-2018/comision-de-la-verdad-la-ley-que-nacio-muerta/> Executive Summary Report,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,<http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/normas/buscar/879> Executive Summary Report,Yes,,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2FPPRiCAqhKb7yhshq%2BGyE5%2BB75n79RS6jeVcVGayuJP9flmdAmnToVlqCALenfGy1rUykHeddHN6F55SNEP8iESP7kkvYITPOjr1ncw5wSh9d15ttAYG32%2FanIURuVUCFMqB37OXUbiqVkTA%3D%3D Executive Summary Report,2020,Yes,The TC itself,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,1,"summons to those whose names and identification document numbers appear as valid in SEGIP [identity service] and SERECI [civic registry]” ; “initiate legal action against Javier Hinojosa Valdez, alias “El Lince”, for his part in the assault on the headquarters of Central Obrero Boliviano (union)” ; summon “non-commissioned officer Raúl Solano Medina” and “Gregorio Loza Balza” to testify about the coup staged by General Meza ; initiate Interpol investigations to locate “Franz Pizarro Solano, alleged perpetrator… against Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz at the headquarters of Central Obrero Boliviano (union)” ; “summon the former morgue Marcelino Fernández to testify… about the fate of the remains of Carlos Flores Bedregal and… Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz”",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,"- Creation of an “Archive of Repression” to identify all detainees and forcibly disappeared persons due to their union or political association; - Allocation of a special budget within the Universal Healthcare System that address the consequences of the regimes through reimbursement and coverage of entry procedures, care, and medications - Official recognition by the government of specific instances of tragedy, including the death of Che Guevara, execution of Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ENL) soldiers, and murder of peasant leader Símon Ramírez - Offer financial award to anyone with information about the remains of Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz - Encourage the creation of museums and research centers for memorialization.",Executive Summary Report,No,Executive Summary Report,"Human Rights Watch. “Bolivia: Events of 2020.” In World Report 2021, 2020. https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/bolivia.

145,41,0,National Truth and Justice Commission,Commission Nationale de Vérité et de Justice (National Truth and Justice Commission),"President Jean Bertrand Aristide, a focal point for the pro-democracy movement that overthrew the military regime of former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier (1971-86), became Haiti’s first democratically elected president in 1990. He attempted to implement a progressive regime, including bringing the military under civilian control, normalizing Haitian Créole culture, and investigating business and political elite for corruption. However, he was met with considerable resistance from the incumbent business, political, and military elite and resorted to unconstitutional means to achieve his agenda through bypassing legislative and judicial authority. This led to mass demonstrations against him, and a military coup led by General Raoul Cedras in September 1991. Cedras oppressed the people of Haiti through extrajudicial execution, forced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, SGBV, and restricted freedom of speech. The OAS and UN condemned his rule, establishing the International Civilian Mission in Haiti to monitor and investigate abuses. The US and other major political-economic powers enacted sanctions against Cedras and his allies in addition to a series of embargoes following Caputo's refusal to return President Aristide to power after the report of the Civilian Mission. Eventually, General Cedras reached an agreement with the US and resigned power, fleeing to Panama. President Aristide was returned to the presidency on October 15, 1994. Through a Presidential Decree, President Aristide created the Commission Nationale de Vérité et de Justice (National Truth and Justice Commission) on March 28, 1995 to investigate human rights abuses during Cedras’ rule September 29, 1991 until October 15, 1994. It had a broad mandate including fact-finding, reconciliation measures, institutional reform, and reparations, and was endowed with considerable power. While it was theoretically able to summon testimony and subpoena documents, the corrupt judiciary did not enforce its summons or subpoenas with the threat of sanction for non-compliance, so this mandated power was practically unavailable to the CNVJ. It is notable that the Haitian diaspora in Canada, including Aristide’s government-in-exile, was incredibly important to raising political will for the CNVJ. In fact, of the 7 commissioners of the CNVJ, several were former diaspora members. Other commissioners were international in conjunction with the UN and OAS. Many Haitians who continued to live in diaspora despite the return of democracy also contributed to the CNVJ through written testimony. In total, the CNVJ took 8,650 testimonies regarding approximately 7,000 initial complaints and named 8,677 victims of 18,629-19,308 violations, indicating that most victims had endured more than 2 violations. It issued its more than 1,000 page report to President Aristide and Parliament in 1996. The report included hundreds of recommendations, largely divisible into 3 categories: SGBV recommendations, reform of the corrupt judiciary, and reparations. While the report is well-detailed, it was widely criticized for being oriented towards researchers and intellectuals, rather than the public. Perhaps this is due to the commission’s organizational structure, which was nearly entirely comprised of intellectuals. Commissioners lamented that the majority of Haitians did not know that the CNVJ even existed. It likely should have included civil society and/or victims’ groups representatives. Most emblematic of the inaccessibility of the CNVJ is the fact that its report was written in French while the majority of the Haitian population speaks Créole, and many cannot read or write. The CNVJ also experienced considerable logistical problems. The report cites a lack of adequate funding and delays in the disbursement of funding in addition to personnel “upheavals.” The international staff of the CNVJ were abroad too often, reducing the CNVJ’s capacity and efficacy. Additionally, since much of the political will for the TJ process came from outside Haiti, the political will for a continued transitional process including the implementation of the CNVJ’s recommendations had largely evaporated from within Haiti after the CNVJ had finished. Despite Aristide’s support for the CNVJ and proclaimed desire to facilitate reconciliation, he neither reproduced the report for public consumption nor implemented any of its recommendations. This includes prosecutions; while the report lists no perpetrator names, the CNVJ submitted a list of perpetrator names to the judiciary for prosecution. However, it was common knowledge that the judiciary was corrupt, a fact that had been acknowledged several times by the TC in its constant demands for judicial reform, so no prosecutions occurred.

39,165,0,Investigative Commission Requested by Senator Juan Carlos Blanco Regarding His Conduct in the Ministry of External Relations in the Case of Elena Quinteros,Investigative Commission Requested by Senator Juan Carlos Blanco Regarding His Conduct in the Ministry of External Relations in the Case of Elena Quinteros,"""The Investigative Commission Requested by Senator Juan Carlos Blanco Regarding His Conduct in the Ministry of External Relations in the Case of Elena Quinteros (hereafter the Investigative Commission) was created by the Uruguayan Senate on June 20, 1990, to determine whether Juan Carlos Blanco, a senator representing the center-right Colorado party, bore any responsibility for the events that unfolded in the case of Elena Quinteros Almeida in late June and early July 1976. At the time, Blanco was Minister of External Relations in the ruling military dictatorship (see entry on Uruguay). In June 1990, the Quinteros Almeida case returned to the spotlight when the Mate Amargo magazine published a secret memorandum outlining the “options” to be discussed in the so-called Venezuela Case during an Uruguayan government meeting in July 1976. Tota Quinteros (Elena's mother) visited the Venezuelan Embassy and asked to see Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle. At the same time, a senator representing the opposition Broad Front asked the Senate to officially request information on the case from the Ministry of External Relations. Given the renewed media and public attention, on June 13, Senator Blanco requested the creation of a Commission, explaining it as indispensable in determining his responsibility in the case (Diary of Sessions, June 13, 1990). The Venezuela Case related to the kidnapping and disappearance of Quinteros Almeida, a married thirty-year-old teacher and member of the Peoples’ Victory Party (Partido por la Victoria del Pueblo), a Marxist political party established in the mid-1970s. On June 26, 1976, Quinteros Almeida was detained by members of the Uruguayan security services and taken to the “300 Carlos” clandestine detention center in Montevideo, the country's capital. Two days later, she convinced her kidnappers to take her to the intersection of Artigas Boulevard and Rivera Street, where she was to meet a “contact.” From the building where she was taken, she jumped into the gardens of the Venezuelan Embassy, where she screamed her name and asked for asylum. Embassy personnel tried to help her, but Quinteros Almeida was forcefully taken away by her captors, who had illegally entered the garden. In the struggle, embassy officials were also hurt. After being kidnapped the second time, she was taken to Infantry Battalion 13 and tortured. To this day, she remains disappeared. The Venezuelan Embassy repeatedly requested an explanation of the events from the Uruguayan government and demanded that Quinteros Almeida be handed over to the Embassy, from which grounds she had been forcefully removed. As the Uruguayan government did not meet these demands, on July 5, 1976, Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations with the country. Relations were reestablished only after Uruguay returned to democracy in 1985. The Investigative Commission worked from June 28 to August 23, 1990, met during twelve sessions, and received important testimonies, including those of Senator Blanco on July 2 and August 16, former Sub-Secretary of External Relations Guido Michelín Salomón, and former Uruguayan Ambassador to Venezuela Julio César Lupinacci. It also examined relevant documents from the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and the Uruguayan Ministries of Interior and External Relations, as well as information collected by the Parliamentary Investigative Commission on the Situation of Disappeared Persons and Its Causes (see separate entry). However, the work of the Investigative Commission was essential in terms of collecting data, recording key testimonies, and gathering a wealth of information that would otherwise have been lost or forgotten. Still, it had serious shortcomings and limitations: it had limited responsibilities and a very short time frame; its undertakings were secret; and its final reports were not disseminated to the public. The drafting of four final reports demonstrates the controversial character and sensitivity of the case examined.""

221,780,0,Presidential Truth Commission on Ethnic Violence,Presidential Truth Commission on Ethnic Violence,"Sri Lanka has been wracked by violent ethnic conflict for 25 years, suffering more than 100,000 conflict-related deaths. Successive attempts to end fighting between Sri Lankan Tamils, traditionally inhabiting the northern and eastern regions, and Sinhalese, concentrated in the central and southern regions, have been tried since the 1950s, but with little success. In 1987, the Sri Lankan government became embroiled in war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Anti-Indian nationalist sentiment in the south fueled an uprising, which was met with harsh government repression. In 1990, President Ranasinghe Premadasa, hoping to pave the way for a negotiated settlement, ordered Indian peacekeeping forces to leave and opened negotiations with the Tamil Tigers who soon broke from the talks and stepped up violence. Throughout this time, the LTTE fought a guerrilla war, bombed central government targets, and captured territory in the north and east. The government response included widespread killings and “disappearances” of suspected insurgents. On December 9, 1994, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga issued three Presidential Proclamations, appointing three different Commissions of Inquiry to look into the “Involuntary Removal or Disappearance of Persons” over the course of the conflict.",domestic,domestic law,President Chandrika Bandaranaike,,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-CommissionEthnicViolence.pdf> https://www.usip.org/publications/1995/01/commissions-inquiry-sri-lanka,2001,2001-07-23,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-CommissionEthnicViolence.pdf>,completed,0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,,,0,1,1,Yes,1987-1991,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,,https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-CommissionEthnicViolence.pdf,don't know,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,Unknown,,,Unknown,Unknown,,,,,2002,Yes,The Commission did,No,,,,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,,executive,prevention of human rights violations; responsibility; historial truth; accountability; reparation; truth for victims,,,,,,,352,777; 776,2024-01-25
178,560,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and oppression in South Africa. While a Dutch and later British colony, South African black Africans were enslaved even after the abolishment of slavery by the British crown, and by its independence in 1910, the white colonialist Afrikaner minority had instituted comprehensive legislation to deny black Africans basic citizenship rights, such as the right to vote, hold office, hold land, equal housing, equal employment, equal education freedom of movement, freedom of association, and many other basic rights. Black Africans were confined to set “reserves” and disallowed from certain public spaces and forced to carry a badge. The Afrikaner nationalist National Party (NP) dominated power from 1948 until the mid-90s. Its control was characterized by an authoritarian political culture of patronage and social stratification to ensure white domination. Between 1960 and 1983, 3.5 million black Africans were forcibly displaced to ten tribal “homelands”. This prompted native South African liberation movements, including the African National Congress (ANC) and the ANC separatist party, the Inthaka Freedom Party (IFP) based in KwaZulu homeland. In the 1980s, resistance to apartheid grew domestically and internationally, prompting the NP regime to declare a national emergency, becoming increasingly brutal and repressive, banning political parties, censuring the media, arbitrarily detaining those suspected to be members of anti-apartheid liberation groups, forcibly disappearing others, and establishing covert death squads through the South African Defence Force (SADF) and South African Police (SAP). The ANC, IFP, and other political groups were forced to convert into informal militarized networks. In the early 1990s, a series of scandals shocked the system when three police officers on death row confessed that they had been trained by the SADF as death squad members, and the public also discovered the existence of a covert SADF “third force” intent on destabilize black African communities, activist networks, and liberation movements. With the election of NP President Frederik Willem de Klerk in 1989, apartheid policies were slightly liberalized. De Klerk made a series of unilateral moves toward negotiation, including freeing ANC leader Nelson Mandela from prison and unbanning political parties. This sudden expansion of formerly clandestine political actors and spaces into legitimacy led to social disruption and violence during negotiations in 1990-1993. The ANC, which wielded greater political power, signed the National Peace Accord in September 1991, but the Accord was opposed by the IFP and right-wing groups, resulting in total deadlock regarding regional autonomy, political and cultural self-determination, and a new constitution in the follow-up Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA). Massacres and politically-motivated hit squad deaths grew exponentially, with the ANC and IFP clashing for power, each establishing their own private militarizes armed with weapons trafficked by the KwaZulu Police (KZP), which was divided along political lines. The threat of violence only increased with the drafting of the 1993 constitution, which led to separatist and right-wing groups storming the World Trade Center, and the first democratic elections in 1994, which the IFP boycotted. ANC candidate Nelson Mandela won those elections, becoming the first anti-apartheid President. On July 19, 1995, the National Parliament enacted the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, which established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It was composed of 17 South African and international commissioners, Chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and a staff of 438 at its peak, with a large budget. The TRC had a complex organizational structure, including Committees on Human Rights Violations, Amnesty, and Reparation and Rehabilitaiton, investigating units, subcommittes, and 5 subnational offices in Johannesburg, East London, Port Elizabeth, Durban, Bloemfontein. This TRC is remarkable because of its powers to encourage testimony: the TRC could grant amnesty to those perpetrators who gave a full confession and pled guilty to human rights violations committed with a political objective, and victims could only be eligible for reparations if they testified in front of the TRC. Due to this remarkable incentive structure, the TRC was able to take 21,298 testimonies, 44.6% of which were taken in the former homeland of KwaZulu—that’s 1.24 statements per 1000 people. According to its final report, it received 7,127 total amnesty application, of which 4,443 were finalized (the remaining 2,684 were for hearable matters, incomplete applications, amnesty granted in part, etc.). Of that 4,443, only 122 were flat-out granted in 1998. But by 2000, 849 had been granted, and 5,392 denied. Although the TRC enjoyed the utmost credibility, many perpetrating groups openly criticized and opposed the Commission, including the IFP and elements of the ANC, thereby dissuading thousands of former or existing supporters from testifying and thus denying them the opportunity for amnesty or reparation. Many NP officials who testified, including former President de Klerk, remained stubbornly unwilling to admit their role in human rights violations. The TRC submitted its 4,000+ page final report to President Mandela in 1998. It was submitted to and published by Parliament, as well as on its website at https://www.justice.gov.za/trc/report/index.htm. It makes some significant conclusions, most importantly about responsibility. Those perpetrators who did not qualify or apply for amnesty were referred to the Attorney General. The TRC’s “main finding” is that “The predominant portion of gross violations of human rights was committed by the former state through its security and law-enforcement agencies. Moreover, the South African state in the period from the late 1970s to early 1990s became involved in activities of a criminal nature when, amongst other things, it knowingly planned, undertook, condoned, and covered up the commission of unlawful acts including the extrajudicial killings of political opponents and others, inside and outside South Africa. In pursuit of these unlawful activities, the state acted in collusion with certain other political groupings, most notably the [IFP].” The TRC concludes that all parties were responsible for the commission of gross violations of human rights, including civil society, liberation movements, political parties, right-wing organizations, and more. However, “the Commission is not of the view that all such parties can be held to be equally culpable for violations committed…” and upholds the ANC’s claim that engaging in the liberation movement was a “just war.” Nonetheless, it stresses that no human rights violations are just, regardless of the justness of the war. The final report also makes hundreds of recommendations, most notably a comprehensive and multilevel reparations plan and a demand that the private sector admit its responsibility and take affirmative action to close the development, employment, and education gaps between white and black South Africans. The TRC has been incredibly influential in the field, although its main criticism is the lack of follow-through on recommendations and the persistent inability to convince the white minority of its own responsibility.",hybrid,domestic law,"Parliament, signed by President Nelson Mandela",,,1995,1995-07-19,<https://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1995-034.pdf>,completed,0,1995,,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,"March 1, 1960 to 1994",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,21000,,fully independent,Yes,17,"Appointed by the President in consultation with the Cabinet.

156,368,0,International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania,International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania,"The Baltic experience of WWII was highly unlike the rest of the world, and particularly the rest of Europe. In 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, dividing up the Baltics into spheres of influence after years of rising tensions. Lithuania was initially assigned to the German sphere, but later transferred to the Soviets. This resulted in Soviet occupation by the Red Army and the creation of the People’s Government of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. Lithuania was rapidly Sovietized; political parties were banned, some 12,000 people were arrested and detained as “enemies of the people,” villagers were killed as displays of force, and private property was stolen from farmers and peasants. Furthermore, this was under Stalin, so forced collectivization resulted in starvation and poverty. When Nazi Germany invaded in 1941, anti-Soviet activists tried to take advantage of a perceived power vacuum with an uprising, but this was quickly subdued by the Nazis. Counterintuitively, Nazi occupation was not the worst existence for most ethnic Lithuanians. “The outbreak of the war in June 1941 meant death for the Jews, but for many Lithuanians it represented a reprieve from deportation if not outright liberation.” Compared to the Soviets, many ethnic Lithuanians were content with their private property restored under Nazi occupation. Furthermore, antisemitic rhetoric was prolific throughout Lithuania. In this way, the Western narrative of WWII is largely irrelevant to Lithuanians. Many anti-Nazi Lithuanians and even escaped Jews joined with the Soviet partisans to fight the Nazis, although many innocent Lithuanians were also killed. When the Soviets reestablished control in 1944, forced conscription into the Red Army was thus met with heavy resistance. Some Lithuanian revolutionaries turned to guerilla tactics in the 1970s, prompting the Soviets to double down on repression, banning all Lithuanian national symbols and killing an estimated 20,000. While guerillas were clearly unsuccessful, they did serve to legitimize and keep alive the Lithuanian will to be independent. Independence movements amplified throughout the 1980s with decline of the Soviet Union’s prowess in the Cold War and the beginning of glasnost and perestroika, prompting the establishment of the Helsinki Group and the Sajüdis, a pro-independence party. In 1990, the Lithuanian Supreme Court declared Lithuania’s independence, and while tensions remained high with the Soviets throughout that year, the Soviet Union fell in 1991. In an effort to deal with this half-century long double-authoritarian occupation, President Valdas Adamkus (1998-2009) established the International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania by Decree No. 159 of September 7, 1998. It had incredibly limited powers—really only the power to research—and a wide mandate that included all human rights violations during the occupation 1940-90, although no dates are specified. The TC was remarkable for a few reasons. First, its commissioners were an unusual mix; they included Holocaust survivors, Israeli and American Jewish civil society representatives, former Soviet supporters, and academics on the Lithuanian occupation. Ultimately, much of the TC’s work was stunted or shaped by the conflicts of interest and apparent political (or otherwise) biases that they held. That being said, many of the commissioners also had unique insight into the conflict by virtue of their proximity and, sometimes, participation. Second, the TC was re-established several times with different commissioners until it was established as a (semi?) permanent body. It was renewed in 2003 and 2005 before a hiatus due to controversy related to the previously mentioned conflicts of interest of one of the commissioners, Dr. Arad, who was a Holocaust survivor who fought as a Soviet partisan until the end of WWII. Beyond epitomizing the commissioners’ unique viewpoints and even limitations, this also brought to the fore a heavier criticism of the TC: that it conflated Nazism and Communism. This grouping together of two very different events and political ideologies that occurred at the same time and weaponized human rights in the same way did not reconcile and even served to reproduce the “scales of suffering” between Jewish Lithuanians victimized by the Nazis and ethnic Lithuanians victimized by the Soviets. Jewish victims and survivors mostly characterized the TC as “a cynical ‘façade-painting’ gambit intended to facilitate Lithuania’s political stature as a candidate for the European Union and NATO.” On the other end of the political spectrum, ethnically Lithuanian critics thought it was financed by the Israeli state. In order to subdue controversy and reduce conflation between the two occupations, when the TC was renewed in 2012 by the decree of President Dalia Grybauskaite (2009-2019), it was specified in the renewing legislation that there would be two sub-committees of the TC: one to analyze the Nazi occupation and one to analyze the Soviet occupation. This attempted to reconcile the “scales of suffering” incurred by the Lithuanian people while under dual occupations. The TC released five volumes between 2006 and 2009, in a series called “The Crimes of the Totalitarian Regimes in Lithuania: The Soviet Occupation."" [For this reason, we code a report as having been produced in 2009] But the commission has produced additional research, as well as other media of memorialization, including a movie, several documentaries, and a children’s storybook.

133,130,0,Truth and Justice Commission,Comisión de Verdad y Justicia (Truth and Justice Commission),"Ecuador returned from military to presidential rule in 1979, but a pattern of authoritarianism and human rights abuses continued. Between 1984 and 1988, President León Febres Cordero’s government led repressive campaigns against student and social movements that opposed his rule. Arbitrary detentions, torture, extrajudicial killings, and forced disappearances were widespread. In 1996, President Abdalá Bucaram was elected. In an attempt to break with the past, he immediately reorganized the state, but by mid-1996, Bucaram was facing pressure to address the past. Bucaram instructed the Ministry of Government and Police to enact Ministerial Accord No. 012, establishing la Comisión de Verdad y Justicia (CVJ, Truth and Justice Commission) to investigate 176 alleged violations of human rights for the past 17 years. Unfortunately, however, Bucaram placed significant trust in his cabinet, many of whom were influenced by the structurally violent and corrupt figures in power since 1979. By late 1996, his administration had been accused of embezzling millions. Ecuador was also being affected by the broader Latin American debt crisis and Mexican peso crisis, leading Bucaram to impose severe austerity measures including privatization and deregulation, thus marginalizing his popular sector support base. This led to mass protest—public figures criticized the disparity between the poor standard of living experienced by the average Ecuadorian and Bucaram’s and his cabinet’s lavish lifestyles. At this protest also emerged speculation that Bucaram was mentally unfit. Although his insanity was never clinically diagnosed, Bucaram’s political opposition ran with allegations that he was not fit to rule. As popular discontentment grew, Congress announced an impeachment vote. In Febuary 1997, Congress impeached Bucaram and dissolved his cabinet. This precipitated the dissolution of the CVJ as its parent organ, the Ministry of Government and Police, was also suspended. Ultimately, this ushered in a period of political turmoil that forced Bucaram to flee. The CVJ was only given a one-year mandate with the possibility of extension in Ministerial Accord No. 012. It was granted significant powers, including the powers to investigate state agents, take testimony, collect forensic evidence, allocate reparations, and contribute to prosecutions by supplementing the judiciary with collected evidence. However, the CVJ did not have the opportunity to take advantage of most of these powers. Three months into its mandate, by the end of 1996, the CVJ reported that it had investigated 300 cases of violations and located a number of unmarked and mass graves in “the Fumisa police precinct, near the town of Quevedo, province of Los Ríos. [They were] said to contain the remains of scores of peasants who had died under torture or been summarily executed during the 1970s.” It is unknown if it had taken any testimony in reference to these findings. At any rate, this testimony was not revealed to the public. By 1997, President Bucaram had been accused of corruption and was widely hated even by his political allies. In February 1997, the Congress deposed Bucaram, effectively dissolving his entire cabinet, including the Ministry of Government and Police, the CVJ’s parent organ. Thus, the CVJ was unable to complete its work. Amnesty International claims that the CVJ’s failure to publish any conclusions, thematic work, or evidence “further consolidated the impunity surrounding hundreds of unresolved cases of torture, “disappearance” and killings.” This is especially true considering that the CVJ’s work was essentially lost—since none of its work product was public or organized in any consolidated way, it disappeared along with the CVJ.",hybrid,domestic law,President Abdalá Bucaram,,,1996,1996-09-17,,completed,0,1996,,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,between 1979 and 1996,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,300,<https://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/ecuador-eng/chaper-2.htm>,partially independent,Yes,7,"The Minister was appointed by President Bucaram, others appointed through a consultative process with national and international human rights organizations",Yes,Unknown,,,<https://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/ecuador-eng/chaper-2.htm>,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,<https://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/ecuador-eng/chaper-2.htm>,,,,,,,,,https://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/ecuador-eng/chaper-2.htm,1997,No,,No,,,,No,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,https://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/ecuador-eng/chaper-2.ht,No,,"“Amnesty International’s Concerns in Ecuador.” Amnesty International, February 1998. https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/amr280011998en.pdf. “Ecuador: Amnesty International Welcomes Truth and Justice Commission.” Amnesty International, September 25, 1996. https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr28/006/1996/en/. “Report on the Situation of Human Rights in Ecuador.” Organization of American States Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, April 24, 1997. https://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/ecuador-eng/index%20-%20ecuador.htm.

49,2,0,Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission (GTRC) is the first truth commission of its kind in the United States. It started its work in the mid-2000s to address the November 3, 1979 events in Greensboro, North Carolina. On November 3, 1979, 15 people were shot; 5 died and 10 were wounded during a Communist Workers Party demonstration to demand racial and economic equality for their low-income neighborhood in opposition to the Ku Klux Khan (KKK). The KKK murdered the protesters and the event became known as the Greensboro Massacre. The 5 victims were: Sandi Smith, Dr. James Waller, Bill Sampson, Cesar Cauce, and Dr. Michael Nathan. It was established by the Greensboro Truth and Community Reconciliation Project (GTCRP), which received funding from the Andrus Family Fund. This commission is an independent body composed of 7 people chosen through""a democratic and community-wide nomination and selected process."" The commission is a private organization and not officially endorsed by the local government. The commission drew upon individual statements from sources such as the news, legal and official governmental documents. The report found the KKK planned to disrupt the march and intended to incite violence. It also found that the Greensboro Police Department were aware of the KKK's intentions but nevertheless made decisions ""not to warn the CWP organizers about the known Klan and Nazi plans to confront and probably provoke physical violence, or that the Klan had obtained a copy of the parade permit"" (Final Report ""Conclusions""). Among the many findings, the report stated that the perpetrators targeted victims of high status, known for their ""leadership roles in union activism.""",domestic,domestic law,"Civil Society and church groups but mayor appointed the selection panel, who chose the 7 commissioners",,,2004,,,,0,2004,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,,"November 3rd, 1979",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,,7,,,,8,425000,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,150,,,,,,,,2006,Yes,the seven commissioners,Yes,,,,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The report did not find the City of Greensboro or its police responsible for the killings, but it criticized police for its handling of the event at the time.

201,552,0,"Commission of Inquiry into the 1st of August 2018 Post-Election Violence, aka the Motlanthe Commisison","Commission of Inquiry into the 1st of August 2018 Post-Election Violence, aka the Motlanthe Commisison","For the first 37 years of its independence, Zimbabwe was under the iron-first rule of Robert Mugabe. Mugabe led the Zimbabwean African National Union (ZANU) in the Rhodesian Bush War, becoming Prime Minister in 1980 and presiding over a period of intense violence between 1980-87. During this time, it is estimated that 20,000 Zimbabweans were killed by security forces in clashes between the ZANU and its main political rival, the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU). In 1987, Mugabe and the ZAPU signed the Unity Accord, which effectively merged the ZANU and ZAPU into the ZANU-PF. In 1981 and ’83, Mugabe established the Dumbutshena and Chihambakwe COIs to investigate the Entumbane Uprising and the Gukurahundi, respectively. Their reports were never released. In 1988, Mugabe enacted Clemency Order 1, which granted widespread amnesty to those involved in human rights violations between 1982 and ’87, including the leader of the notorious Central Intelligence Organization, Emmerson Mnangagwa. Successive election periods were characterized by mass fraud, violence, and new amnesties for ZANU-PF abusers. This includes the murder of opposition candidate Patrick Kombayi in 1993 and thousands of claims of torture, beatings, arson, and kidnapping against opposition activists and supporters during the 1995 and 2000 Parliamentary and 2008 Presidential elections. In 2008-2013, Mugabe was forced into a power-sharing agreement with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), which introduced the 2013 Constitution, although the ZANU-PF blocked many of the reforms it contained. 2013-2017, Mugabe’s health deteriorated and disagreements internal to ZANU-PF proliferated. When Mugabe fired Mnangagwa, speculation roared that Mugabe planned to appoint an unpopular successor. In response, Mnangagwa and the Zimbabwe National Army placed Mugabe under house arrest, after which he was formally impeached, and Mnangagwa became interim President until the 2018 elections. The MDC candidate Nelson Chamisa garnered considerable popular support in the Presidential campaign. As elections preceded, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission was accused of lacking independence as small-scale violence occurred at poling stations. It also took nearly two weeks for the ZEC to count the vote, despite the fact that it was using the same counting mechanism as for Parliamentary elections, the results of which were announced within a few days. When it was announced that Mnangagwa won the elections, MCD supporters took to the streets to protest the results and the alleged election fraud. The military was called out, and opened fire on the protestors, killing at least six. Chamisa also opened a court case when the numbers revealed that the ZEC accepted that over 300,000 people had voted at one polling station in one hour. The court case was dismissed, and Mnangagwa preceded to the Presidency. The Commission of Inquiry Act was first enacted July 4, 1941 and was amended by Act 15/1981. It stipulated that the President may issue a proclamation to create a COI whenever he considers it advisable. In reaction to outrage with the violence, Mnangagwa announced that a Commission of Inquiry into the 1st of August 2018 Post-Election Violence would be created to investigate the post-election violence. However, Mnangagwa made this announcement before he was sworn in as President while the election was still being contested in court. President Mnangagwa had no policy power when the COI was first announced (without a proclamation) in August. Critics allege that Mnangagwa created the COI in anticipation that there would not be a runoff election, presumably because he knew that the court ruling on the election case was also not independent from his party, the ZANU-PF. Further, since no cabinet had been appointed, Mnangagwa is in violation of the COI Act, which stipulates that a COI must be established in consultation with the cabinet. Nonetheless, when he was work in in September, he issued a proclamation formally creating the COI. It was empowered by the COI Act to compel testimony and the production of documents under oath. Should any person or institution fail to comply with a summons or subpoena, the COI was empowered to hold them accountable for criminal contempt punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both. During the course of its investigations, it traveled to Mutare, Gweru, Bulawayo and Harare and heard 164 testimonies. Critics allege that the COI was not independent. One of its 7 commissioners, Charity Manyeruke, was a notorious ZANU-PF “apologist”, another, Lovemore Madhuku, was a 2018 ZANU-PF candidate who denounced the opposition for alleging that elections were rigged and publicly expressed her support for Mnangagwa. Other commissioners included international representatives, who were a façade of independence, according to news reports. Critics also alleged that the COI was pointless and redundant, since its purpose was to determine who gave the Defense Forces the order to shoot, and yet, under the 2013 Constitution, only the President can issue orders to the Defense Forces. Human rights organizations like Amnesty International also claim that the COI’s findings are based on partially fabricated evidence. The COI readily accepted a paper trail from the government with several gaps without mentioning these gaps in the report. For example, six of the letters relating to deployment are timestamped within 90 minutes of each other, meaning that the COI accepted without question that six letters with extensive citations to constitutional articles and other laws and all containing the same grammatical errors were separately written, printed, and hand delivered across the country within the span of 90 minutes. Its findings were also biased toward the ZANU-PF official rhetoric. It found that the MDC alliance had planned and incited the riots, and that the events of the day justified the deployment of the military. It upheld the order to call out the military despite finding that the protests were widely peaceful. The COI further asserted that those “responsible” for the violence, i.e. the opposition figures, should be held criminally responsible.",domestic,domestic law,President Mnangagwa,,,2018,2018-09-12,"<https://www.law.co.zw/download/commissions-of-inquiry-act/#:~:text=AN%20ACT%20to%20provide%20for,or%20connected%20with%20the%20foregoing>.",completed,0,2018,"<https://www.law.co.zw/download/commissions-of-inquiry-act/#:~:text=AN%20ACT%20to%20provide%20for,or%20connected%20with%20the%20foregoing>.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"The events immediately preceding, during, and after 1 August 2018",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,41,<https://kubatana.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Final-Report-of-the-Commission-of-Inquiry-18-DEC-18.pdf> <http://www.veritaszim.net/sites/veritas_d/files/SI%20181-2018%20Proclamaition%206.pdf>,not independent,Yes,7,"Named in Proclamation No. 6/2018, i.e. appointed by President Mnangagwe",No,Yes,,,<https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/09/zimbabwe-doubts-over-commission-of-inquirys-independence-puts-justice-for-post-election-killings-at-risk/> <https://reliefweb.int/report/zimbabwe/motlanthe-commission-s-anniversary-shame> <https://kubatana.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Final-Report-of-the-Commission-of-Inquiry-18-DEC-18.pdf> <http://www.veritaszim.net/sites/veritas_d/files/SI%20181-2018%20Proclamaition%206.pdf>,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://kubatana.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Final-Report-of-the-Commission-of-Inquiry-18-DEC-18.pdf>,Yes,164,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,https://kubatana.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Final-Report-of-the-Commission-of-Inquiry-18-DEC-18.pdf http://www.veritaszim.net/sites/veritas_d/files/SI%20181-2018%20Proclamaition%206.pdf,2018,Yes,The COI handed its report to President Mnangagwa and published it on its website.,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,1,"Criminally prosecuting “those responsible for alleged crimes on 1 August 2018,” who, according to the report, are the MCD opposition leaders; “internally sanctioning” those military who killed civilians",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,awareness campaign so that political parties are more aware of their responsibilities to peaceful demonstrations and respect of national security; implementation of new technology to expedite the communication of electoral results to the Command Center.,<https://kubatana.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Final-Report-of-the-Commission-of-Inquiry-18-DEC-18.pdf> <http://www.veritaszim.net/sites/veritas_d/files/SI%20181-2018%20Proclamaition%206.pdf>,No,,"Amnesty International. “Zimbabwe: Doubts over Commission of Inquiry’s Independence Puts Justice for Post-Election Killings at Risk,” September 19, 2018. https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/09/zimbabwe-doubts-over-commission-of-inquirys-independence-puts-justice-for-post-election-killings-at-risk/. “The Motlanthe Commission’s Anniversary of Shame - Zimbabwe | ReliefWeb.” Accessed August 9, 2022. https://reliefweb.int/report/zimbabwe/motlanthe-commission-s-anniversary-shame.

They were a compendium of facts discovered in the archives about the previous regime’s repression under President Marcello Caetano, election fraud, the political police, political prisoners, political discrimination in the workplace, student and worker opposition to the dictatorship, and other repressive and anti-democratic practices of the previous government. The TC did not enjoy much publicity, and its reports did not have much impact within Portugal.

186,380,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"Sámi territory stretches across the northern parts of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and into Russia. In the early 17th century, ethnic Swedes, Norwegians, and Finns began encroaching on Sámi land, first taking it as farmland and later for industries including forestry and mining. This stymied Sámi’s traditional reindeer husbandry, denying them access to a practice necessary for their socioeconomic livelihoods as well as their cultural identity. Some Sámi were also incorporated into a corveé system of forced labor in the mines, further impoverishing Sámi households. The Swedish government became even more forceful in the 18th century—as Sámis became more and more impoverished, they were unable to pay “tribute” on their land like other subjects. The government thus enacted the Lappmark Regulations, enforcing non-Sámi settlements in the Sámi territory. This began a period of involuntary assimilation into “modern” ways of life and culture, especially through forced conversion to Christianity and reeducation of Sámi children in residential schools overseen by the Church of Sweden. Dehumanizing racial biology research was actively pursued by scientists and sponsored by the Swedish government as late as the 1960s, measuring and categorizing Sámi bodies, brains, and abilities. These and other policies have violated the Sámi’s civil, political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental rights and human dignity, and had a lasting impact on the psychosocial development and political-economic inclusion of indigenous groups in Sweden. In recent years, the Sámi have lobbied the Swedish state for increased participation and self-determination, including achieving legislation that formed the Sámi Parliament in 1993, the incorporation of indigenous rights into the Swedish Constitution, and the ratification of human rights treaties and conventions regarding indigenous rights. Despite this de jure progress, the Swedish government has continued to violate Sámi territory, in particular by inviting or allowing heavy industries to conduct commercial activities that often degrade or threaten to degrade the environment on which the Sámi rely for their continuing reindeer husbandry and other cultural and socioeconomic practices. In 2016, the Sámi parliament published a study on Sámi mental health, which noted that there were a high number of suicides among young Sámi men, particularly reindeer herders, who felt that they and their people had no future as their territory was being chipped away by industries. This report sparked strong reactions from Sámi parliamentarians and civil society, leading to a round table event at the end of 2016. At this roundtable, referencing the Canadian TRC’s success in 2015, talk of a Swedish Truth Commission first begun. In June 2019, the Sámi parliament sent a request to the Sametinget to consider the possibility of a Truth Commission. Later that year, 25 Sámi skulls that had been excavated, examined, and displayed by the Historical Museum in Stockholm were repatriated to the Sámi with an apology from the Museum. At the ceremony returning the skulls, Minister of Culture and Democracy Helene Öberg stated that the government was open to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and that its work appears necessary to reconcile the state and Sámi, and to further their quality of life day-to-day. The Sametinget allocated SEK 1.2 million ($115,000) to a consultative study of Sámi and ethnic Swedish perceptions of transitional justice, which produced findings overwhelmingly in favor of a Truth Commission. On 3 November 2021, the Sametinget followed through, creating a Truth and Reconciliation Commission intended not only to conduct a historical investigation into the pattern of repression and mistreatment of Sámi in the past, but also to educate ethnic Swedes about the Sámi history and culture and propose solutions for the better treatment of Sámi in the present. In this way, the TRC is not a post-authoritarian nor a post-conflict TC, rather an indigenous-specific post-atrocity TC. The following week, the Church of Sweden formally apologized for its role in the repression and mistreatment of Sámi. The Sametinget apparently announced the appointment of the TRC’s commissioners in Spring 2022, but this information cannot be found. Members of the Sámi parliament and other Sámi representatives have expressed their desire for the TRC to include Sámi representatives from neighboring Sámi territories in Norway and Finland, but it is unclear whether this has come to pass—thus, the TRC could be hybrid or domestic. The TRC is set to publish the findings of its historical investigation in December 2025.",domestic,domestic law,The Sametinget,,<https://www.sametinget.se/truth-commission>,2021,2021-11-03,,ongoing,0,2022,<https://www.sametinget.se/truth-commission>,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,yes,yes,1,1,0,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,,<https://www.sametinget.se/truth-commission> <https://perma.cc/5R28-L99U>,fully independent,Yes,,,Yes,Unknown,,115000,[https://www.rcinet.ca/eye-on-the-arctic/2020/06/17/Sámi-in-sweden-start-work-on-structure-of-truth-and-reconciliation-commission/](https://www.rcinet.ca/eye-on-the-arctic/2020/06/17/sami-in-sweden-start-work-on-structure-of-truth-and-reconciliation-commission/),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,"Quinn, Eilís, and Eye on the Arctic. “Sami in Sweden Start Work on Structure of Truth and Reconciliation Commission.” Eye on the Arctic (blog), June 17, 2020. https://www.rcinet.ca/eye-on-the-arctic/2020/06/17/sami-in-sweden-start-work-on-structure-of-truth-and-reconciliation-commission/. sweden.se. “Sami in Sweden,” June 9, 2022. https://sweden.se/life/people/sami-in-sweden. solivri. “Truth Commissions in the Nordic States: Who Is to Be Reconciled with Whom?” JusticeInfo.Net (blog), December 2, 2021. https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/85028-truth-commissions-nordic-states-who-is-to-be-reconciled-with-whom.html.

155,450,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia,Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia,"Sergeant Samuel Doe overthrew the democratically elected government of Liberia in 1980 and installed a military junta backed by enthnosocial groups disenfranchised since the country’s founding. As promised, Doe held elections in 1985, but they were widely considered fraudulent. Doe increased and expanded repression after a failed military coup that exacerbated his already heightened paranoia, resulting in inhuman treatment of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups, who were charged with treason. A former member of Doe's cabinet exiled for embezzlement, Charles Taylor, manipulated rising ethnic tensions to his advantage, creating a government-in-exile in Cote d’Ivoire that artificially represented the Gio and Mano’s interests. Taylor formed an army, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and invaded on December 24, 1989, ushering in the First Liberian Civil War (1989-1997). An estimated 200,000 were killed, thousands were forced to flee, infrastructure was entirely destroyed, and all sides made notorious use of child soldiers. In 1990, ECOWAS deployed a joint military intervention force under Nigerian leadership to impose a ceasefire and convince Doe to remove himself to exile. Doe was ultimately captured, tortured, killed, and dismembered on video by the INPFL, a splinter faction from the NPFL. This left a power vacuum where 15+ paramilitaries vied for territorial control. Violence and hostilities continued through ceasefire discussions, resulting in the creation of the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL). Several of the UNOMIL members were kidnapped by warring factions. A ceasefire was finally brokered in 1995. Elections were held in 1997, but due to the lack of demilitarization, the environment was hardly conducive to freedom and fairness, resulting in the fraudulent ascension of Taylor and the NPFL to the Presidency and National Assembly. Taylor did nothing to stymie violence and was accused of supporting guerillas in neighboring countries and embezzling diamond money for luxuries and arms while the Liberian people were further impoverished. Former guerillas in the diaspora who had formed a paramilitary coalition during the war began reformed into LURD and began making territorial advances. With backing from neighboring Guinea, LURD began the Second Liberian Civil War (1999-2003). Another rebel group, MODEL, emerged, and by early 2003, Taylor’s government controlled only 1/3 of Liberian territory. LURD laid siege to the capital, Monrovia, resulting in mass exodus, killing, and starvation. Taylor resigned in August 2003 with the signing of the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ushered in the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL), overseen by Interim President Gyude Bryant. The Accra CPA Article XIII required a TRC, which was formally established by the National Transitional Legislative Assembly on May 12, 2005. It had extensive powers, including summons and subpoena, enforceable by its quasi-judicial component, the Special Magistrate. Its mandated content was also extensive, encompassing all human rights violations January 1979 to October 14, 2003 with a special focus on violence against women and children. It was composed of nine Liberian commissioners, four of whom were women and 5 of whom were civil society representatives, including journalists, an HIV/AIDS specialist, and religious leaders. The TRC established local offices in each of Liberia’s 15 counties, and uniquely included the diaspora at every step to encourage testimony and participants’ ownership of the TJ process. Despite complications with security, staff, and funding resulting in hearings not beginning until 2008, the TRC collected over 22,000 witness statements from 17,000 victims, witnesses, and perps, over 800 of which were heard at formal hearings. Many hearings were public, although the TRC reserved the right to hold private hearings for the dignity of victims and witness protection. The transcripts and in camera recordings of those hearings that were public are available for review on the TRC’s website. The TRC came to significant conclusions. It documented 27 different perpetrating groups, including 10 warring factions that were responsible for 96% of the violations. It found that the NPFL was not only responsible for the most violations, but responsible for “more than three times the number of reported violations as the next closest perpetrator group or warring faction.” It was also the only warring faction that operated in all 15 of Liberia’s counties. The TRC concluded that poverty, greed, corruption, limited access to education, economic, social, civil and political inequalities; identity conflict; land tenure and distribution; the lack of reliable and appropriate mechanisms for the settlement of disputes; as well as the duality of the Liberian political, social and legal systems served to polarize and widen the disparities between the settler Liberians and indigenous Liberians. It also made numerous recommendations, especially focusing on economic, social, and cultural rights, women’s, children’s, and indigenous rights, corruption reform, and an Extraordinary Criminal Tribunal for Liberia to try those 106 perpetrators recommended for prosecution. While the TRC was empowered to recommend individuals for amnesty, it did not recommend any adults for amnesty, only recommending that child soldiers receive amnesty. Many recommendations were enacted, including economic empowerment and poverty reduction strategies, the National Palava Hut Programme, the Whistle Blower Act of 2012, decentralization of political and economic power, constitutional review, justice sector reform, police reform, promotion of good governance and the rule of law, and the establishment of the Independent National Commission on Human Rights. However, some recommendations have been largely ignored. There have been no domestic prosecutions for human rights violations, despite civil society demands for a war crimes tribunal and a resolution passed in the House but never tabled in the Senate. The only relevant prosecution is of Charles Taylor by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, who found him guilty of aiding and abetting crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Sierra Leone conflict while he was President of Liberia. However, he has not been tried for crimes in Liberia itself.",domestic,domestic law,The National Transitional Legislative Assembly and President Gyude Bryant,,,2005,2005-05-12,[https://web.archive.org/web/20170502235720/http://trcofliberia.org/about/trc-mandate](https://web.archive.org/web/20170502235720/http:/trcofliberia.org/about/trc-mandate),completed,0,2006,[https://web.archive.org/web/20170502235720/http://trcofliberia.org/about/trc-mandate](https://web.archive.org/web/20170502235720/http:/trcofliberia.org/about/trc-mandate),1,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,"January 1979 to October 14, 2003",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,163615,[https://web.archive.org/web/20170502235720/http://trcofliberia.org/about/trc-mandate](https://web.archive.org/web/20170502235720/http:/trcofliberia.org/about/trc-mandate),fully independent,Yes,9,"The Chairman of the NTGL had already appointed Commissioners, but in an effort to ensure that the TRC process was credible and consultative, the TRC mandate sets out a procedure for vetting and appointing commissioners.

Despite the presence of Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, and Druze, Christians were favored in politics due to the presence of a strong pro-Western Christian political elite reinforced by the French Mandate (1920-43). Many Muslims grew discontented with their lack of political representation and contributed to the growth of pan-Arabism, promoting left-wing politics in Lebanon. The influx of thousands of Palestinians after World War II constituted a demographic shift in favor of the Muslim population, and as Cold War politics took hold, Lebanon became polarized. Muslim populations increasingly supported the Soviets while the Christian political majority remained aligned with the West. In 1975, the nationalist Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) began fighting with Christian militias, prompting a rapid militarization of each political interest group, including pan-Arabist left-wing Lebanese National Movement (LNM). This signaled the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War. By 1976, Syria had intervened in support of the PLO, attempting to serve its own political and territorial interests, including rooting out Sunni cells and the anti-Ba’athist Muslim Brotherhood. The Arab League granted Syria permission to maintain its troops in Lebanon as an Arab Deterrent Force (ADF). In 1977, the ADF and Christian militia engaged in the Hundred Days War, after which the ADF was ordered to leave Lebanon. Lebanese forces increasingly attacked Israeli territory, prompting Israeli and US involvement in favor of the Christian majority. Paramilitary forces, political groups, split off factions, and foreign alliances shifted rapidly. In 1982, the US and UN stationed the Multinational Force in Lebanon to oversee the withdrawal of PLO and Syrian troops, but later that year, Iran got involved in the war, financing the creation of Hezbollah. Fighting did not ebb until the signing of the Tarif Agreement in 1989, even after which it continued in East Beirut. The US unfairly brokered tensions between Israel, Syria, and Lebanon, driven by its own alliances and interests in the Gulf War to act preferentially toward Israel and Syria. Overall, during the civil war, 17,415 Lebanese disappeared or were abducted by the various militant groups. According to Amnesty International, the Lebanese officials have ""generally failed to protect mass graves and to conduct exhumations from the civil war period.” In 1991, Lebanon enacted Law No. 84, which imposed blanket amnesty on political crimes during the civil war. The families of the disappeared nonetheless were very active in demanding investigations into their relatives. The Committee of the Families of the Kidnapped and Disappeared in Lebanon (CFKDL) conducted advocacy demanding that the government locate the bodies or at least acknowledge the disappeared. It organized sit-ins, protests, outreach to international human rights organizations, lobbying, and public awareness campaigns that can largely be credited for forcing the Lebanese government to acknowledge the disappeared. In January 2000, Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss signed into law Resolution No. 60/2000, which created the Official Commission of Investigation into the Fate of the Abducted and Disappeared Persons to investigate and “resolve” the 17,000 disappearances that occurred during the Lebanese Civil War and its aftermath, from 1975-1999. The COI was initially only granted three months to complete its work, but the CFKDL and other human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, claimed that this was an intentional limitation placed on the COI to prevent genuine truth-seeking. The COI’s mandate was thus extended to six months. Over the course of its mandate, it received 2,046 applications from the families of victims. The COI lacked independence; it was entirely composed of Army officers, intelligence officers and other members of security forces. Thus, it treated state actors preferentially—while it did not offer victims’ families the opportunity to testify, it did allow perpetrators implicated by the victims’ families to defend themselves in closed-door, private testimony. Although it completed a final report in July 2000, this report was delivered directly to the Prime Minister and was not released. This is likely because political authorities in power were involved in the disappearances and thus had an interest in preventing the release of any information that could implicate them or their forces. A three-page “summary report” was issued to the public, which claimed that “bodies were discarded in different places in Beirut, Mount Lebanon, the North, Bekaa and the South; and some were buried in mass graves.” It mentioned specifically three burial sites (the St. Demetrious Cemetery in Achrafieh, the Martyrs' Cemetery in Horsh Beirut and the English Cemetery in Tahwita) and reported that some bodies were thrown to the sea. It concluded that apart from 17 people detained in Israel, all those missing for four years should be considered dead, and recommended that their families register their deaths with local law enforcement. The Commission lost significant credibility as this last claim was proved to be false when 54 Lebanese disappeared persons who had been missing for more than four years were released from a Syrian prison in December 2000, only five months after the report was released. It also failed to tell the families of the disappeared anything that they didn’t already know. In 2009, the Committee of the Families of the Kidnapped and Disappeared in Lebanon (CFKDL) and Support of Lebanese in Detention and Exile (SOLIDE) petitioned the the Juge des Référés (Judge of Summary Procedures of Beirut) to grant a preliminary order requiring the release of the report (as well as the unreleased report of the follow-up “Alternative” Commission of 2001) in anticipation for the case’s judgement. The Court obliged, ordering the Council of Ministers to hand over the reports to the Court, and ultimately to the families of the disappeared. The Council of Ministers refused to comply. The Court also discovered that the COI had not investigated the individual circumstances of the 2,046 applications it received, rather had simply accepted the applications and never taken action.",domestic,domestic law,Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss,,,2000,2000-01-21,,completed,0,2000,,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,1975-1999,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,17415,<https://www.counterpart.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Case-Study-5_Committee-of-the-Families-of-the-Kidnapped-and-Disappeared.pdf> <https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/04/12/disappearances-lebanon>,not independent,Yes,5,Appointed by Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss in consultation with the Council of Ministers,No,Unknown,,,<https://www.counterpart.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Case-Study-5_Committee-of-the-Families-of-the-Kidnapped-and-Disappeared.pdf> <https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/04/12/disappearances-lebanon>,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Yes,,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,,2000,Yes,"The COI itself handed its report to Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss.

168,95,0,Panama Truth Commission,Comisión de la Verdad Panamá (Panama Truth Commission),"In 1968, President Arnulfo Arias was elected in Panama. After just 11 days in office, he was couped and a military junta was installed, at first led by various puppets and later led by Omar Torrijos. The junta severely repressed opposition, banning political activity and taking over the media, all while advancing a populist agenda in rhetorical favor of poor workers and peasants. However, as Torrijos’ rule continued, it became clear that he and the rest of the military were profiting off of state resources, leading to a pro-democracy guerilla movement against which the military committed human rights violations. Torrijos is notable for his negotiations with US President Carter to obtain gradual national sovereignty over the Panama Canal in 1977. In his final years, he partially liberalized his regime in an attempt to court the US in negotiations, legalizing political parties and establishing his own, the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD). In 1981, Torrijos died in an airplane accident. After his death, General Manuel Noriega took power, reversing this (minimal) liberal progress. Noriega preferred to stay behind the scenes and ruled through various military puppets, and in 1984, he allowed Presidential elections for the first time in 16 years. But when it became clear that the PRD candidate was losing to formerly overthrown President Arias, he manipulated the count. The US, which was still present in Panama, accepted the results due to a strategic alliance with Noriega to bring down the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. This relationship continued for years, but Noriega became increasingly problematic. In addition to blatant corruption, Noriega trafficked arms and drugs. In 1985, several high-profile murders of opposition occurred, and it was revealed that Noriega was selling US intelligence to Fidel Castro, prompting the US to stop economic assistance in 1987. In 1989, the fraudulent elections prompted rioting, violence, and the church’s involvement in denouncing Noriega. This instability, including the killing of a US Marine, precipitated US invasion. Noriega surrendered to the US in January 1990 and was convicted by a Miami court for his trafficking crimes. Finally, in 1999, the widow of overthrown President Arias, Miereya Moscoso, was elected president. In 2000, exhumations at a former military base revealed four human skeletons, including one mistakenly thought to belong to Jose Hector Gallego, a Colombian priest abducted by the military in 1971. The Attorney General refused to investigate or conduct further exhumations, citing a lack of resources. On January 18, 2001, Moscoso enacted Executive Decree No. 2 establishing la Comisión de la Verdad Panamá (Panama Truth Commission) to fill this gap. The TC was composed of 7 commissioners and empowered to investigate “violations of the fundamental human rights of life” and disappearance. The TC interpreted this to mean death and disappearance, including torture that resulted in death and arbitrary detention that resulted in disappearance. Its final report also includes sexual violence. While the TC had no powers to compel, it could take testimony and access official documents. Its mandate is emphatic that it is not a judicial body and thus cannot attribute responsibility for any crimes. Perhaps this was due to tension with the Attorney General’s office, which was supported by and filled with members of the PRD, which still supported the dictatorship. In fact, the PRD labeled the TC as a smear campaign and threatened to use the courts to overturn the Executive Decree. A few commissioners and staff even received threats against their physical integrity. The TC also encountered other difficulties—it was established 10 years after the end of the dictatorship, which itself lasted for 20. Many of the crimes it was investigating were more than 30 years old; evidence had been erased, witnesses had forgotten or died, and some documents had even been destroyed. Halfway through its six-month (extended) mandate, the TC realized that 15,000 pages of relevant files had been seized by the US during invasion. It requested the declassification of those documents from the US Dept. of State, which (surprisingly) granted it access to 1,375 documents from the US National Archives. In addition, the TC consulted with public administrations, experts (including Priscilla Hayner), and civil society. In total, they received 176 referrals, 66 of which were outside their mandate but 110—70 deaths and 40 disappearances—were investigated as formal cases. It took 147 testimonies, including from (low-level) military perpetrators. The Anthropology Team was its most notable feature. With the help of Argentinian forensics, a $15,000 donation from Germany, and a bone-tracking dog named Eagle, the TC conducted 36 clandestine grave excavations, discovered 48 distinct human remains and positively identified 28 individuals through DNA samples tested against family members’ saliva. In its final report, the TC has individual sections dedicated to each named victim. The names of victims were also published in various widely circulated magazines and newspapers. The TC report concludes that 50% of violations were committed between 1968-77, 40% of victims were between the age 19-30, 58% were lower class, and 47% were workers or farmers. It also emphasized the psychological effects of victimhood, mentioning socioeconomic deterioration, “educational truncation” of family members, nuclear family disintegration, social isolation resulting from state persecution, the loss of health, and depression, fear, and anxiety. The report attributes responsibility to the military, but also singles out the judicial system as complicit in the violations, noting that the resulting legal framework persists to the time of writing. The TC makes various recommendations, including for reparations, a Special Prosecutor, checks on the security forces to guarantee civilian control, universal human rights education, and the creation of a government agency to continue the TC’s work. After the report, the TC was renewed until 2004 as the Office for Follow-up of the Institutional Truth Commission (Comisión Institucional de la Verdad–Oficina de Seguimiento).",domestic,domestic law,President Mireya Moscoso,,,2001,2001-01-18,<https://www.usip.org/publications/2001/01/truth-commission-panama>,completed,0,2001,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/resources/Panama-Charter.pdf>,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,1968-1989,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,110,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/resources/Panama-Charter.pdf> <https://hmcwordpress.humanities.mcmaster.ca/Truthcommissions/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Panama.PTC_.Report-Part1.pdf>,fully independent,Yes,7,"Named in the Executive Decree, i.e. appointed by the President.",No,Yes,14,500000,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/resources/Panama-Charter.pdf> <https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-apr-18-mn-38542-story.html> <https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9953&context=noticen> <https://hmcwordpress.humanities.mcmaster.ca/Truthcommissions/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Panama.PTC_.Report-Part1.pdf>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/resources/Panama-Charter.pdf>,Yes,147,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/resources/Panama-Charter.pdf https://hmcwordpress.humanities.mcmaster.ca/Truthcommissions/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Panama.PTC_.Report-Part1.pdf,2002,Yes,"Published by the TC as a book and printed by Impresos Tavial, S.A.",Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,0,,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,"A federal holiday the “day of the disappeared” to commemorate the disappeared and act as a state form of victim recognition.

184,780,0,"Commission of Inquiry into the Involuntary Removal or Disappearance of Persons in the Western, Southern, and Sabaragamuwa Provinces","Commission of Inquiry into the Involuntary Removal or Disappearance of Persons in the Western, Southern, and Sabaragamuwa Provinces","For most of its contemporary history, Sri Lanka has experienced ethnic competition between its two predominant groups, Hindu Tamils and Buddhist Sinhalese. Oscillating ethnicities of prime ministers and cabinets after independence from the British in 1948 led to each administration enacting discriminatory legislation against the other ethnicity in an attempt to consolidate an ethnic monopoly on political power. This resulted in the Sinhala Only Act, which made Sinhala the official language, a symbolic act of Sinhalese majority oppression of the Tamil minority. Through the 1950s, successive presidents attempted to unite the country and put an end to ethnic grievances, but to no success. The manipulation of these grievances in electoral politics in the 1960s led to two problems: first, a youth crisis, which produced the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), and second, a growing militant sentiment among the Tamil in the North during the 1970s. The JVP, a Marxist-Leninist militant organization, staged an unsuccessful coup in 1971. In 1975, Tamil militants assassinated a local Sinhalese mayor, and in 1976, the ad hoc Tamil guerilla forces consolidated into the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Beginning in 1983, Tamil clashed with government security forces, resulting in race riots and increased organizational capacity—the LTTE received arms, food, and training from India (Tamils and India share Hindu nationalism) as it attempted to establish its own independent state. This is the official beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War, which would not end until 2009. In 1987, the Sri Lankan government and Indian government signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, which made significant concessions to Tamils, including the devolution of state authority and an open door for their future independence, but also authorized the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) to neutralize the LTTE. Exploiting this distraction and the widespread anti-Indian Sinhalese sentiment angry with the government for making concessions, the JVP launched a second insurrection. The LTTE-Indian violence and the Sri Lankan government-JVP violence caused widespread chaos, guerilla tactics, targeting civilian victims, and suicide bombs. The government response included widespread killings and “disappearances” of suspected insurgents. The government won a decisive military victory against the JVP by 1990. In a desperate hope for peaceful negotiated settlement, President Ranasinghe Premadasa ordered the IPKF to leave in 1990 and opened negotiations with the LTTE. Violence only increased, although it was more contained—the LTTE expelled the Sri Lankan Muslims in an act of ethnic cleansing. By the late 1990s, negotiations had begun. In 2002, the LTTE and Sri Lanka signed a ceasefire brokered by Norway. Violence continued until 2009. In 1995, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga created three “zonal” Commissions of Inquiry into the Involuntary Removal or Disappearance of Persons—one for the Central, North West, North Central and Uva Provinces, one for the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and one for the Western, Southern, and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. They all completed work in 1997, when President Kumaratunga created an “All Island” COI to synthesize their work and fill in remaining gaps. The “zonal” COI for the Western, Southern, and Sabaragamuwa Provinces was created by a Proclamation in Gazette 855/20 published on January 25, 1995. The COI was composed of three commissioners, Chaired by Madam Manouri Kokila Muttetuwegama. It only had four months to complete its investigations. It had a topic-specific mandate limiting the scope of inquiry to disappearances and arbitrary detentions, and it had limited powers, with no power to compel. The Commission was housed in the Superior Courts Complex of the Ministry of Justice in Colombo. It also held decentralized public hearings by partnering with district and provincial authorities. The ongoing civil war put the COI in extreme insecurity, a logistical obstacle that prevented the COI from inquiring into all of its received complaints and completing all of its planned hearings. In total, it received 8,739 complaints, held inquiries in 7,761 cases, and heard 9,744 witnesses. Of the 8,739 violations before the COI, 4,858 were perpetrated by state security forces, 779 by subversive groups (LTTE and JVP), 59 by personal enemies acting in collaboration with agents of the state or paramilitary, and 1,543 by unknown individuals. 96% of the complaints occurred between 1988 and 1991. The COI was particularly emphatic that criminal trials be held, emphasizing the importance of criminal liability to security reform and reparations. In its notes on responsibility, it mostly condemned the state security apparatus, highlighting the “utmost care that had been taken not only by individual perpetrators but also by the system itself to prevent the occurrences from being reflected in the official records.” Unlike the other COIs with which it was commissioned, it also documented certain important trends. First, “There was a perception that the JVP had targeted outstanding youth who revealed leadership quality at village-level for recruitment. This led to the ""elimination of outstanding youth"" at the local community level.” Without any foundation for or even suspicions of youth’s participation in the JVP, many youths were forcibly disappeared simply because of their outstanding qualities, which were perceived as making them vulnerable to radicalization. Second, the COI received testimony from some returned detainees. This revealed the serious injuries associated with torture, the lengths to which captors went to guarantee secrecy, and confession under duress leading to “extermination.” Finally, the COI investigates sexual abuse in detention, a topic not specifically mandated but nonetheless important. This COI’s recommendations were also more comprehensive than the other two COIs with which it was commissioned. It recommends reforms to detainee treatment and prison conditions, comprehensive reparations for families, reforms to lessen gender discrimination, especially in owning property and financial independence for female-headed households, a Legal Advisory/Assistance Bureau to process habeas corpus applications related to the disappearances, and a special independent prosecutor for human rights violations.",domestic,domestic law,Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,,,1995,1995-01-25,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-20.pdf>,completed,0,1995,,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,yes,yes,0,1,1,Yes,“anytime after January 1988”,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,8739,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-20.pdf>,partially independent,Yes,3,"Named in the Proclamation, i.e. appointed by President Kumaratunga",No,Yes,30,,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-20.pdf>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-20.pdf>,Yes,9744,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-20.pdf,1997,Yes,The COI published its own report.,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,1,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,teacher training and sensitization to the emotional rehabilitation of victims and their families. develop forensic training and professionals in order excavate mass graves efficiently and effectively,,No,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-20.pdf>,"United States Institute of Peace. “Commissions of Inquiry: Sri Lanka.” Accessed July 28, 2022. https://www.usip.org/publications/1995/01/commissions-inquiry-sri-lanka. “Recurring Nightmare: State Responsibility for ‘Disappearances’ and Abductions in Sri Lanka: II.

202,552,0,"Zimbabwe Commission of Inquiry into the Events Surrounding Etumbane, aka the Dumbutshena Commission of Inquiry","Zimbabwe Commission of Inquiry into the Events Surrounding Etumbane, aka the Dumbutshena Commission of Inquiry","For the first 37 years of its independence, Zimbabwe was under the iron-first rule of Robert Mugabe. Mugabe was a revolutionary hero, the leader of the Zimbabwean African National Union (ZANU) until 1980 and served also as the leader of its successor, the ZANU Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), until 2017. During British rule, when Zimbabwe was still Rhodesia, Mugabe was forced to flee to Mozambique after making anti-colonialism and anti-monarchy statements that angered the white minority. While in Mozambique, he established the ZANU and orchestrated its involvement in the Rhodesian Bush War, through which Rhodesia was granted independence in 1980. Mugabe and the ZANU easily won the 1980 elections, becoming Prime Minister and promoting socialist rhetoric, aligning Zimbabwe with China. He and other ZANU members ideologically conflicted with a paradoxically remarkably similar party, the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU), which had also been established under British rule and also supported socialism, but rather chose to align themselves with the USSR. The main difference was that ZANU supported race reconciliation and rural peasantry mobilization, while ZAPU supported Black nationalism and urban worker mobilization. ZAPU was largely made up of former guerrillas, who were increasingly disgruntled with Mugabe and the ZANU. The military wing of ZAPU, the Zimbabwe People’s Revolutionary Armu (ZIPRA), rebelled in the city of Bulwayo’s western suburb, Entumbane. The ZANU paramilitary, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), retaliated, attacking both ZIPRA and government security forces during the chaotic conflict. The ZANLA and ZIPRA were both also in the midst of being incorporated in the formal Zimbabwe Army. This clash, where nearly every security force and paramilitary fought each other, was largely a result of ideological tensions, both real and perceived race politics, and too many armed forces being combined into one against their will. Around 300 died. Just two years later, Mugabe set the North Korea-trained Fifth Brigade to suppress the ZAPU stronghold in Matabeleland, committing mass atrocity in what is known as the Gukurahundi. The ZAPU-ZANU violence continued at a less intense pace until the Unity Accord of 1987, signed by Mugabe and ZAPU leader Joshua Nkoma, which effectively merged the ZANU and ZAPU into the ZANU-PF. The Commission of Inquiry Act was first enacted July 4, 1941 and was amended by Act 15/1981. It stipulated that the President may issue a proclamation to create a COI whenever he considers it advisable. Pursuant to this Act, President Mugabe proclaimed that a COI would be created in March 1981 to investigate the massacres, and the Zimbabwe Commission of Inquiry into the Events Surrounding Etumbane began its work later that year. It was composed of seven commissioners and was chaired by Chief Justice Enoch Dumbutshena, the popular namesake of the COI. The Dumbutshena Commission was empowered by the COI Act to compel testimony and the production of documents under oath. Should any person or institution fail to comply with a summons or subpoena, the COI was empowered to hold them accountable for criminal contempt punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both. Its terms of reference were to “inquire into the mutinous disturbances which took place during February 1981 at Glenville Military Camp, Ntabazinduna Military Camp, and Entumbane ZANLA and ZIPRA Camps for the purpose of determining the causes underlying, or which led to, the mutinous behavior and of identifying, if possible, the persons and organizations responsible for planning or promoting the disturbances; and to make recommendations for the resolution of the problems identified.” Although Dumbutshena was a member of the Judicial System who could be considered complicit as an employee of the state, it was common knowledge that he was an outspoken advocate for judicial independence. The first Black justice on the Supreme Court, Dumbutshena had a reputation for convicting members of the state security forces and paramilitaries of torture and other violations, and publicly critiqued Mugabe for his violations of rule of law. Later in his career, he toured Africa advocating for more consistent application of the African Charter for Human and People’s Rights, and even tried to start his own party and campaign against Mugabe. While this means that Dumbutshena was not a Mugabe pawn, it does not necessarily mean he was impartial; clearly Dumbutshena had a political agenda, even if that agenda was friendly to human rights and rule of law. Unfortunately, however, the final report was never published. Apparently, Mugabe felt that the Commission failed because the report did not clearly condemn either side. This has led to speculation that Dumbutshena’s report favored ZIPRA over Mugabe’s ZANLA. In 2000, two human rights groups, the Legal Resources Foundation and the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, filed suit in the High Court seeking an order compelling Mugabe to make public the Dumbutshena report along with the report of the COI created two years later in 1983, the Chihambakwe Commission. Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was an architect of the massacres with Presidential aspirations, informed the High Court that the reports could no longer be located, alleging that it had been lost. In 2019, after Mnangagwa became President, a new National Peace and Reconciliation Commission attempted to access the Dumbutshena and Chihambakwe reports but was again rejected and informed that the reports had been lost. The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace has confirmed over 2,000 deaths, 680 house burnings, at least 10,000 detained, and at least 7,000 tortured and/or wounded 1980-88. It further estimates that the death toll is closer to 3,000 or 4,000. In 1988, Mugabe granted widespread amnesty to the ZANU-PF for human rights violations.",domestic,domestic law,President Mugabe,,,1981,1981-03-01,"<https://www.law.co.zw/download/commissions-of-inquiry-act/#:~:text=AN%20ACT%20to%20provide%20for,or%20connected%20with%20the%20foregoing>.",completed,0,1981,,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"The events preceding, during, and immediately after February 1981",1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,<https://www.zimlive.com/2019/04/dumbutshena-chihambakwe-reports-have-been-lost-nprc-chairman/> <https://books.google.com/books?id=MNJkEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT120&lpg=PT120&dq=%22dumbutshena+commission%22&source=bl&ots=HGqor-QTgc&sig=ACfU3U2ukOc8hzL1q1a617ayZ2R7XlX9JQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3zY2m97X5AhU-EGIAHVmxA3EQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=%22dumbutshena%20commission%22&f=false>,partially independent,Yes,7,"According to the COI Act, they were appointed by President Mugabe",No,Yes,,,<https://twitter.com/zenzele/status/1120712243379867648> <https://advance-lexis-com.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/document/teaserdocument/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=abafa73d-c305-436a-8f41-12783c313b37&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A3SJ4-FSN0-000B-450R-00000-00&pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A3SJ4-FSN0-000B-450R-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8078&pdteaserkey=h1&pditab=allpods&ecomp=rz2yk&earg=sr0&prid=a5b5eae2-56f5-4b7f-b248-3840eb15b15a> <https://advance-lexis-com.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=136ad726-1d8a-4e95-a736-4224f476590b&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A3SJB-3FR0-000W-B2BP-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8078&pdteaserkey=sr2&pditab=allpods&ecomp=rz2yk&earg=sr2&prid=a5b5eae2-56f5-4b7f-b248-3840eb15b15a> <https://advance-lexis-com.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=d7dcd716-889f-48d3-ac43-7332a5b72c9d&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A40FN-1TX0-00VY-72C8-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=138620&pdteaserkey=sr4&pditab=allpods&ecomp=rz2yk&earg=sr4&prid=a5b5eae2-56f5-4b7f-b248-3840eb15b15a> <https://advance-lexis-com.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=d4516de0-6e6d-4c79-ab27-397aa266c7b0&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A3SPF-M4H0-001G-V10V-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8001&pdteaserkey=sr7&pditab=allpods&ecomp=rz2yk&earg=sr7&prid=a5b5eae2-56f5-4b7f-b248-3840eb15b15a> <https://advance-lexis-com.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=32c3a554-649b-42a9-99ec-37f0f2509389&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A3SJB-GRJ0-001X-R1K1-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8076&pdteaserkey=sr2&pditab=allpods&ecomp=rz2yk&earg=sr2&prid=fa2a9e83-152d-48e2-bacc-47ff5c6aefa3>,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,"<https://www.law.co.zw/download/commissions-of-inquiry-act/#:~:text=AN%20ACT%20to%20provide%20for,or%20connected%20with%20the%20foregoing>.",Yes,,No,Yes,Yes,Unknown,,,"https://www.law.co.zw/download/commissions-of-inquiry-act/#:~:text=AN%20ACT%20to%20provide%20for,or%20connected%20with%20the%20foregoing.",1982,Yes,The Dumbutshena Commission handed its final report directly to President Mugabe,No,,,,Unknown,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,<https://www.zimlive.com/2019/04/dumbutshena-chihambakwe-reports-have-been-lost-nprc-chairman/> <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/sena.12247> <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1161277.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A3212741811f133d491bba0781aacd1ab&ab_segments=&origin=&acceptTC=1>,No,,"Alexander, Jocelyn. “Dissident Perspectives on Zimbabwe’s Post-Independence War.” Africa: Journal of the International African Institute 68, no. 2 (1998): 151–82. https://doi.org/10.2307/1161277.

136,366,0,"Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes against Humanity, aka the Max Jakobson Commission","Inimsusevastaste Kuritegude Uurimise Eesti Rahvusvahelise Komisjoni, aka Max Jakobsoni komisjoni (Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes against Humanity, aka the Max Jakobson Commission)","The Baltic experience of WWII was highly unlike the rest of the world, and particularly the rest of Europe. In 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, dividing up the Baltics into spheres of influence after years of rising tensions. Estonia was assigned to the Soviets, resulting in occupation by the Red Army and the creation of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ESSR). Estonia was rapidly Sovietized; political parties were banned, mass deportations, detentions, and forced drafting targeted “enemies of the people,” including the so-called “Forrest Brothers” resistance movement, and private property was stolen from farmers and peasants. Furthermore, this was under Stalin, so forced collectivization resulted in starvation and poverty. When Nazi Germany invaded in 1941, many ethnic Estonians, including the “Forest Brothers”, supported it, willingly joining the German-controlled Estonian subadministration, the Directorate. Nazi occupation may have meant death for ethnic minorities, but for many Estonians it represented a “reprieve from deportation if not outright liberation.” Compared to the Soviets, many ethnic Estonians were content with their private property restored under Nazi occupation. In this way, the Western narrative of WWII is largely irrelevant to Estonians. When the Soviets reestablished control in 1944, forced conscription into the Red Army was thus met with heavy resistance. Some Estonian revolutionaries turned back to the guerilla tactics of the “Forest Brothers”, prompting the Soviets to double down on repression, not only reinitiating the process of collectivization, but also beginning the process of Russification, inducing Russians to settle in Estonia. The Soviets also began deporting Estonians to labor camps, where thousands were forced into slavery, died, or were executed. After the death of Stalin in 1953, Soviet policies relaxed considerably, and independence movements amplified throughout the 1980s as the USSR’s power began to slip in the Cold War. With glasnost and perestroika, Estonian resistance grew, and mass collaborative protest across the Baltics led to the establishment of the Congress of Estonia to represent the people. In 1991, a referendum was held for Estonian independence, and the last Russian troops left Estonia in 1994. In 1998, President Lennart Meri established the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes against Humanity to investigate the periods of totalitarianism and the countless crimes committed in Estonia and on ethnic Estonians. Meri aimed to put an end to the polarization produced by competing narratives about the Soviet and German regimes and their respective resistance movements. Hence, a very important part of the Commission’s mandate was to avoid “double standards” and “overcome[e] the stereotypes about groups that were the basis of many of these crimes.” In order to produce the most independent and unbiased research possible, Meri announced that there would not be any Estonian commissioners. Instead, there were 7 international commissioners, headed by Max Jakobson, a Finnish-Jewish diplomat instrumental in shaping Finland’s neutrality during the Cold War. The Commission adopted the Rome Statute’s multilevel definition of crime against humanity, identifying over 200,000 victims of these crimes. It used a historical investigative methodology, relying on documents rather than testimony. It produced 3 reports: the first on the period 1940-41, the second 1941-44, and the third 1944-mid-50s. The Commission conducted in-depth analysis and made significant, precise conclusions. In the 1940-41 report, the commission concludes that responsibility largely lies with the political officials and members of the public who prepared and carried out the take-over. Specifically, the Commission singles out the Vares’ government and the Riigivolikogu (National Representative Assembly) as immediately responsible for the implementation of the sovietization of Estonia. It documents 94,961 victims in 1940-41, including 7,000+ arrests, 1,850 of which were executed and 4,500 of which died in prison; 35,961 civilian deportations, 3,150 of which were executed or died; 50,000 Estonian Army deportations under the auspices of joining the Red Army; and 2,000 summary executions of civilians. It finds that a variety of military tribunals made most of these decisions. Although it blames Stalin as most responsible, it claims that individual criminal responsibility lies with the NKVD group and local operators, who are named in the report. In the 1940-44 report, the Commission documents 29,000 victims. It notes that 75% of Estonia’s Jewish community managed to escape to the USSR, but virtually all the remaining Jews—between 950 and 1,000—were killed by the end of 1941. In addition, between 400 and 1,000 Roma, at least 5,000 Jews deported from other German-occupied territories, 6,000 ethnic Estonians, and 1,000 ethnic Russians were killed. Out of some 30,000+ Soviet POWs held in Estonia, 15,000 or more died or were killed. The commission also finds that almost all those held in camps (mostly Jews and Soviet POWs) were subjected to enslavement. Further, it concludes that these violations were (mostly) willingly carried out by Estonian police, military, and executives under the Directorate. The report attributes the most responsibility for the 1941-44 violations to certain named officials of the Directorate, including every member of the Political Police. In the 1944-1998 report, the Commission finds that most violations concerned the mobilization of Estonian men into the Red Army, arbitrary detention and execution of politicians, anti-Soviet resistance movement members and their families, “traitors to the motherland”. The Commission again blames Stalin and a number of named Estonian perps, in addition to responsible institutions, including the NKGB/KGB, “Smersh” (counterintelligence military), and NKVD. Finally, it notes that after Stalin’s death, Soviet policies of repression generally relaxed. Accordingly, it cuts off its own temporal mandate at the mid-1950s. In conclusion, the Commission’s final report notes that while Soviet occupation was incredibly destructive to Estonia and its people, this cannot justify the violence perpetrated by Estonians against Jews, Roma, and Soviets during the Holocaust. It emphasizes that “being a victim does not preclude acts of perpetration.” The Commission submitted its final report in 2008. Its work has been used by the European Court of Human Rights and others.

204,552,0,National Peace and Reconciliation Commission,National Peace and Reconciliation Commission,"For the first 37 years of its independence, Zimbabwe was under the iron-first rule of Robert Mugabe. Mugabe led the Zimbabwean African National Union (ZANU) in the Rhodesian Bush War, becoming Prime Minister and aligning with communist China. He ideologically conflicted with a paradoxically similar party, the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU), which also supported socialism, but rather aligned with the USSR. ZAPU was largely made up of former guerillas, who were increasingly disgruntled with Mugabe and the ZANU. The military wing of ZAPU, the Zimbabwe People’s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) rebelled in the city of Bulwayo’s western suburb, Entumbane, in 1981. The ZANU paramilitary, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), retaliated, attacking both ZIPRA and government security forces during the chaotic conflict. This clash was the beginning of a period of intense violence. In 1982 and ’83, Mugabe set the North Korea-trained Fifth Brigade to suppress the ZAPU civilian stronghold in Matabeleland, committing mass atrocity against villagers in what is known as the Gukurahundi. In 1987, Mugabe and the ZAPU signed the Unity Accord, which effectively merged the ZANU and ZAPU into the ZANU-PF. It is estimated that between 1980-87, 20,000 Zimbabweans were killed by security forces. In 1981 and ’83, Mugabe established the Dumbutshena and Chihambakwe COIs to investigate the Entumbane Uprising and the Gukurahundi, respectively. Their reports were never released. In 1988, Mugabe enacted Clemency Order 1, which granted widespread amnesty to those involved in human rights violations between 1982 and ’87, including the leader of the notorious Central Intelligence Organization, Emmerson Mnangagwa. Successive election periods were characterized by mass fraud, violence, and new amnesties for ZANU-PF abusers. This includes the murder of opposition candidate Patrick Kombayi in 1993 and thousands of claims of torture, beatings, arson, and kidnapping against opposition activists and supporters during the 1995 and 2000 Parliamentary and 2008 Presidential elections. In 2000, the ZANU-PF carried out violent invasions of white-owned farms; in 2005, it conducted a terror and intimidation campaign in urban areas known as Operation Mnangagwa, “clearing out the filth”, displacing 700,000. In 2008-2013, Mugabe was forced into a power-sharing agreement with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, which introduced the 2013 Constitution, although the ZANU-PF blocked many of the reforms it contained. 2013-2017, Mugabe’s health deteriorated and disagreements internal to ZANU-PF proliferated. When Mugabe fired Mnangagwa, speculation roared that Mugabe planned to appoint an unpopular successor. In response, Mnangagwa and the Zimbabwe National Army placed Mugabe under house arrest, after which he was formally impeached, and Mnangagwa became interim President until the 2018 elections, which were widely contested and highly violent, but Mnangagwa nonetheless won. Chapter 12 of the 2013 Constitution set up five independent commissions to set up a cohesive and peaceful future. One of them is the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission. Parliament encountered resistance and suffered a lack of political will, so the NPRC was not established until 2018, when Act No. 11/2017 was promulgated into law. The NPRC was given a 10-year mandate, with powers to compel testimony and documents from private individuals and public agencies. It can hold individuals in criminal contempt, perjury, and obstruction with the threat of fine, imprisonment, or both, although it is reliant on Administrative Courts to administer these penalties. Parliament can also enforce its subpoenas for documents from recalcitrant public agencies. Nonetheless, its mandate was disappointing to many. First, the NPRC does not have a sufficient truth-seeking mandate. Its mandate is heavily focused on future-looking reconciliation and peace, which is commendable, but scholars note that there are still competing narratives and public confusion about what happened in the 1980s. Zimbabwe is a special case because many of those responsible for past violations are still in power, including Mnangagwa. The suppression of truth-telling reports in the past and the consistent culture of victim-blaming cannot be rectified with just peace and reconciliation. Second, the NPRC lacks independence. Despite being empowered Parliament rather than Presidential Decree, it is administered by the Office of the Vice President, so the executive still retains considerable control. All of its funding, resources, and regulations are via an executive middleman. Article 10(7) of Act No. 11/2017 also stipulates that the National Security Minister can at any time block the disclosure of testimony, documentation, and other evidence acquired by the NPRC that they think is “contrary to public interest on the grounds that it may prejudice the defence, external relations, internal security or economic interests of the State.” Hence, the NPRC is censored by the Mnangagwa-appointed National Security Minister based on their whim of what “contrary to public interest” means. However, the ongoing NPRC so far has exceeded expectations. Selo Masole Nare, the Chair of 8 other commissioners, was a magistrate in Matabeleland during the Gukurahundi and has claimed his personal experiences enable him to withstand political manipulation. It has received and investigated 2,811 cases of violations, commenting on the continued problems with land, resource, and aid distribution and the near-constant episodes of police brutality, among other violations. The NPRC is also heavily decentralized and prioritizes grassroots capacity building. It has held monthly roundtables with political parties, civil society representatives, and local stakeholders. At its regional offices, it also holds peace events and public hearings. The NPRC also has a gender lens; each annual report, it makes recommendations towards lessening SGBV and gender discrimination. Further, its provincial Peace Committees are staffed with local people for additional sensitivity to local needs and specific types of victimization.",domestic,domestic law,"Drafted and passed by Parliament, signed into law by President Mnangagwa",,,2018,2018-01-05,<http://www.nprc.org.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NPRC-Act-No-112017.pdf>,aborted,0,2018,<http://www.nprc.org.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NPRC-Act-No-112017.pdf>,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,no,yes,0,1,0,,,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,,<http://www.nprc.org.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NPRC-Act-No-112017.pdf>,partially independent,Yes,9,"According to Act No. 11/2017, the chairperson of the NPRC was “appointed by the President after consultation with the Judicial Service Commission and the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders,” while the remaining commissioners were appointed by the President from a list of 12 nominees submitted by the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders.",No,Yes,572,177800000,<http://www.nprc.org.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NPRC-Act-No-112017.pdf> <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10246029.2022.2086475?needAccess=true> <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350218960_A_Vehicle_for_Peacebuilding_or_Cloak_of_Impunity_The_Zimbabwe_National_Peace_and_Reconciliation_Commission> <https://www.chronicle.co.zw/retired-judge-sows-seeds-of-peace-reconciliation/>,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,<http://www.nprc.org.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NPRC-Act-No-112017.pdf>,Yes,,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,http://www.nprc.org.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NPRC-Act-No-112017.pdf,,No,"The NPRC releases annual reports.

121,20,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"The Canadian repression of its five indigenous nations, including the Inuit, Métis, and First Nations, was particularly brutal due to its selective persecution of indigenous youth. Through a network of “boarding schools” funded by the Canadian government’s Indian Affairs and Northern Development and administered by various Christian churches, particularly the Catholic Church, indigenous youth were subject to cruel treatments and violations of human rights. The purported purpose of the schools was to “assimilate” indigenous youth to Canadian Christian culture, but in reality, the children were victims of an institutionalized ethnic cleansing mechanism that removed them from their communities and forcibly neglected, abused, and starved them, often to death, in insufficient housing exposed to fire and snow. This generated a pervasive mental health crisis among indigenous youth. During the 1990s, many indigenous communities began publicly accusing the Canadian government of systemic abuse and threatening legal penalties. In 1996, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples issued a report recommending that the government take action to address this increasingly obvious pattern of past human rights violations. The last Indian Residential School (IRS) closed a year later, in 1997. In the early 2000s, the legal office of attorney Tony Merchant began representing over 7,000 survivors in a class action lawsuit against the Canadian government that used the Royal Commission’s report as government-recognized evidence. The Canadian government, recognizing that it had to take action, began working with the class action counsel, representatives of victims groups, representatives of Inuit, Métis, and the First Nations to reach a settlement for the suit. Out of this $1.9 billion settlement, which created a system of reparations called the Common Experience Payment for IRS students, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement was born. The IRSSA was a formal peace agreement between Inuit, Métis, the Assembly of First Nations, the Catholic, Anglican, and United Methodist Churches of Canada, and the Canadian government to administer the Common Experience Payment and ensure a commitment to peace and nonrecurrence. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a required part of the IRSS, which was signed on May 8, 2006 and promulgated September 19, 2007. The TRC was nontraditional in that it did not seek any judicial or prosecutorial action; its historical fact-finding mission was heavily victim-focused to allow victims psychological closure and force the Canadian government and Christian churches to accept responsibility and be held accountable. Additionally, it did not have any time period restrictions, rather, it was restricted to only content relevant to the schools, not all general human rights violations against the indigenous peoples of Canada through colonial expansion. The TRC does not have powers of subpoena or summons, but the IRSSA does state that the Canadian government and the churches are “required” to compile relevant documents and provide access to their archives for review by the TRC. Its 5-year mandate was divided into two timelines: the first two years were dedicated to budget creation, initial research, and a report on historic findings while the last three years were to dedicated to community truth and reconciliation events, statement-taking, truth-sharing, and the establishment of a Research Center. Events were a large part of the TRC’s mandate, which required national events to share information from communities and promote the empowerment of survivors and victims; community events to respond to the needs of victims on-the-ground, including education, statement records, and participation from church, school employees, and government officials; individual statement-taking/truth-sharing; and closing ceremonies. The TRC’s original budget of $60 million was expanded to approximately $72 million, and it was granted a one-year extension in January 2014 to complete its operations in June 2015. By August 2012, the federal government had released over 941,000 documents to the TRC related to residential schools. By the time it released its Final Report in June 2015, the TRC had identified over 150,000 residential school survivors, confirmed 3,201 residential school deaths and estimated 6,000 more after hearing 6,500 testimonies. The TRC makes 94 “calls to action” recommendations, including eliminating education, health, and employment gaps between Aboriginals and white Canadians, enacting legislation to protect Aboriginal rights, modifying the foster care system to protect Aboriginal youth, changing prejudicial elements of the criminal code, and changing the Oath of Citizenship to include a vow to uphold indigenous treaties. All of the TRC’s records were transferred to and are publicly available at the National Truth and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba, which it chose to entrust with the archives rather than the Canadian government to remove the possibility that in the future, the archives could be tampered with or withheld from the public. This is representative of the TRC’s commitment to impartiality. It was reported that the TRC took “careful steps to maintain its independence,” including moving its entire national operations to Winnepeg to be closer to the survivor population and to distance itself from the “heavy-handed Canadian government” in Ottowa. The TRC’s recommendations and conclusions are still incredibly pertinent.

138,375,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission Concerning the Sámi People,Truth and Reconciliation Commission Concerning the Sámi People,"Sámi territory stretches across the northern parts of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and into Russia. Although ethnic Sámi and ethnic Finns have a common indigenous ancestor, the Sámi remained nomadic while the Finns became agrarian, beginning to encroach on Sámi land in the 17th century for farmland and later for industries like forestry and mining. This stymied Sámi’s traditional reindeer husbandry, denying them access to a practice necessary for their socioeconomic livelihoods as well as their cultural identity. As Finns consolidated power, they began taxing Sámi, seizing indigenous land when Sámis could not pay. This began a period of enforced assimilation, especially through language policies, Finnish settlement on Sámi land, and forced conversion to Christianity, resulting in the reeducation of Sámi children in residential schools overseen by the Church. Dehumanizing racial biology research was actively pursued by scientists and sponsored by the Finnish government as late as the 1960s, measuring and categorizing Sámi bodies, brains, and abilities. These and other policies have violated the Sámi’s civil, political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental rights and human dignity, and had a lasting impact on the psychosocial development and political-economic inclusion of indigenous groups in Finland. In recent years, the Sámi have lobbied the Finnish state for increased participation and self-determination, including achieving legislation that formed the Sámi Parliament in 1973, the incorporation of indigenous rights into the Finnish Constitution, the ratification of human rights treaties and conventions regarding indigenous rights, and the clarification of Sámi language rights in schools and private life in 1992. Despite this de jure progress, the Finnish government has continued to violate Sámi territory, in particular by inviting or allowing heavy industries to conduct commercial activities that often degrade or threaten to degrade the environment on which the Sámi rely for their continuing reindeer husbandry and other cultural and socioeconomic practices. Finland is also the only Scandinavian country in which non-Sámi are permitted to herd reindeer. Since the success of the Canadian TRC was revealed by its report in 2015, the Sámi Parliament in Finland has been exploring the conditions for a future commission in Finland. As Norway and Sweden preceded with their own truth commissions, the political will for one in Finland increased. The Action Plan of the Finnish Sámi Parliament 2016-19 included the establishment of a truth commission, and throughout this period, it held conferences with transitional justice experts and Sámi civil society to establish the groundwork. In 2019, the Finnish government allocated EUR 1.5 million for the research and design of the truth commission, and negotiations for its structure and mandate were formally launched between the Sámi Parliament, Finnish Parliament, and Prime Minister’s Office. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission Concerning the Sámi People was official appointed on the 28 October 2021, and its mandate was released 30 October 2021. The mandate set up the TRC as a historical inquiry focused on the examination of historical documents about the repression and mistreatment of Sámi, an awareness campaign for the education of ethnic Finns about the Sámi history and culture, and a dialogue intended to propose solutions for the better treatment of Sámi in the present. Initially, it aimed to conclude its work in November 2022, but this end date has been extended until December 2023 due to setbacks. It has 5 commissioners, two of which were appointed by the Skolt Village Assembly. This appointment procedure has been criticized by Sámi civil society which view truth and reconciliation as apolitical. They state that “The Sámi people do not think they can trust a commission appointed jointly by the government and the Sámi Parliament… both the government and the Sámi Parliament are seen as political actors and… in the eyes of the Sámi, the commission becomes political. The indigenous Sámi do not want the process to be political.” Further criticism has been levied at the TRC by its commissioners, as well. In May 2022, commissioners Heikki J. Hyvärin and Miina Surujärvi resigned, along with the TRC’s Secretary General, Anni-Kristiina Juuso, due to the government’s failure to meet certain obligations. The commissioners claim that time, financial resources, and staff are insufficient for the “monumental task” which they have been assigned. Further, the TRC does not offer sufficient opportunities for “ordinary” Sámi to participate. In the words of the resigned Sámi commissioner Surujärvi, “this entity has not worked, and it will not work.” She and the two other resigned believe that the TRC should be reformed before it proceeds with its tasks. The TRC’s tasks have not been well-publicized. It is clear that it seeks to hear testimony from Sámi survivors of residential schools and other collectively victimizing assimilation policies in the style of the Canadian TRC, but it is unclear whether these activities have actually occurred. The TRC lacks coercive powers to compel testimony or the production of documents; its mandate states “It is hoped that the various authorities will cooperate with the commission and assist it in carrying out its tasks when the commission so requests.” So, historical inquiry is effectively limited to willing testimony and historical documents and commentaries contained in scientific or research institutions. For the time being, the TRC is proceeding with its work with only three commissioners and without sufficient resources. It remains to be seen if its mandate will change in line with commissioner and civil society demands.",domestic,domestic law,Prime Minister Sanna Marin,,<https://www.arctictoday.com/important-undertaking-begins-as-finland-seats-sami-truth-and-reconciliation-commission/>,2021,2021-10-28,<https://vnk.fi/documents/10616/20470117/TSK-mandaatti+31.10.2019_en.pdf/a2abea1d-3a53-e35e-c281-2495a9ab4d69/TSK-mandaatti+31.10.2019_en.pdf/TSK-mandaatti+31.10.2019_en.pdf?t=1579014781000>,completed,0,2021,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,yes,yes,1,1,0,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,,<https://vnk.fi/documents/10616/20470117/TSK-mandaatti+31.10.2019_en.pdf/a2abea1d-3a53-e35e-c281-2495a9ab4d69/TSK-mandaatti+31.10.2019_en.pdf/TSK-mandaatti+31.10.2019_en.pdf?t=1579014781000>,fully independent,Yes,5,"According to the mandate, “The members of the truth and reconciliation commission shall be people who enjoy widespread trust among the Sámi and Finnish society.” They must have special historical, language, or cultural expertise relevant to the Sámi.

185,780,0,Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission,Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission,"For most of its contemporary history, Sri Lanka has experienced ethnic competition between its two predominant groups, Hindu Tamils and Buddhist Sinhalese. Oscillating ethnicities of prime ministers and cabinets after independence from the British in 1948 led to each administration enacting discriminatory legislation against the other ethnicity in an attempt to consolidate an ethnic monopoly on political power. The manipulation of ethnic grievances in electoral politics in the 1960s led to a growing militant sentiment among the Tamil in the North during the 1970s. In 1971, Tamil militants began orchestrating organized violence in response to a policy of standardization that aimed to decrease the number of Tamil students in university education. In 1975, Tamil militants assassinated a local Sinhalese mayor, and in 1976, the ad hoc Tamil guerilla forces consolidated into the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Beginning in 1983, Tamil clashed with government security forces, resulting in race riots and increased organizational capacity—the LTTE received arms, food, and training from India (Tamils and India share Hindu nationalism) as it attempted to establish its own independent state. This is the official beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War, which would not end until 2009. In 1987, the Sri Lankan government and Indian government signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, which made significant concessions to Tamils, including the devolution of state authority and an open door for their future independence, but also authorized the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) to neutralize the LTTE. In a desperate hope for peaceful negotiated settlement, President Ranasinghe Premadasa ordered the IPKF to recede in 1990 and opened negotiations with the LTTE. Violence only increased—the LTTE began resorting to terrorist tactics, including suicide bombings, and expelled Sri Lankan Muslims in an act of ethnic cleansing. By the late 1990s, negotiations had begun due to exhaustion with the war—by this time, human rights group estimate that the conflict had generated over 1 million IDPs. Hopes for peace were crushed with a LTTE offensive launched in 2001, but in 2002, the LTTE and Sri Lanka signed a ceasefire brokered by Norway. Although violence continued, especially within LTTE ranks, the ceasefire largely held until socioeconomic turmoil after a 2004 Tsunami precipitated the assassination of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a Tamil who was highly respected by foreign diplomats and who had been sharply critical of the LTTE. This renewed the civil war, but the LTTE was much weakened with less international support and internal divisions, leading to a Sri Lankan military victory in 2009. Several truth commissions had previously investigated the state policy of forced disappearance and arbitrary detention—3 “zonal” and 1 “all Island” Commissions of Inquiry into the Involuntary Removal or Disappearance of Persons in 1995 and 1998 condemned the security forces and demanded prosecutions and exhumations. However, these conclusions and recommendations were sidelined by the ongoing war. On June 16, 2010, President Mahinda Rajapaska enacted Proclamation No. 1658/19, creating the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. The LLRC mandate was immediately criticized. The Proclamation asks the LLRC to investigate “the facts and circumstances which led to the failure of the ceasefire agreement … and the sequence of events that followed thereafter.” Nowhere does it specify specifically the scope of the referenced “events,” only alluding to the “sufferings” “of the conflict phase.” Human rights or war crimes are not mentioned once in the mandate. More than anything else then, the Proclamation sets up the LLRC as a war inquiry commission. Further criticism relates to its organizational structure. Like the COIs that prefaced it, the LLRC is under the executive and lacks formal independence—its commissioners and structure are dictated by the President. It had 9 commissioners, of whom 7 were Sinhalese. Its Chair, Chitta Ranjan de Silva, faced allegations in 2006 of obstructing justice in relation to two cases of human rights violations, and the rest of the commissioners were largely agents of the state, many of whom publicly defended Sri Lankan security forces’ conduct and argued that they did not commit war crimes. International and national human rights groups alleged that the LLRC was a way to deflect calls for an international criminal tribunal, since the Sri Lankan government consistently “used the LLRC as its trump card in lobbying against an independent international investigation,” according to Amnesty International. Sri Lankan officials painted the LLRC as an alternative mechanism of accountability, but its mandate clearly did not provide any opportunities for accountability. The LLRC’s final report, published in 2011, was somewhat redeeming but whitewashed the violations committed by Sri Lankan forces. Despite its limited mandate, the LLRC outlines the legal frameworks of international humanitarian law and human rights law and applies them to the Sri Lankan context, emphasizing civilian death and casualty, humanitarian relief like food and medicine, conscription of underage children, summary or arbitrary executions, and violations of freedom of expression, association, and religion in addition to disappearance, displacement, etc. During its investigations, the LLRC received over 6,000 written and oral testimonies. It conducted public hearings in affected areas across the nation. Those testimonies received at public hearings are available as transcripts. Nonetheless, the LLRC whitewashes violations committed by Sri Lankan forces while overemphasizing the violations committed by the LTTE. The report finds that the Sri Lankan forces did not violate international humanitarian law because they did prioritize civilian safety above all else. It claims that the violations of relief heard in testimony—such as the shelling of hospitals and targeting of civilians—were essentially inescapable (and thus excusable) in the midst of internal war. It also rejects the UN and other international NGO’s victim estimates while providing no estimate of its own, arguing that “it is not possible to establish a verified figure given the difficult circumstances of the situation… [the lack of military records] has contributed to the unverified sweeping generalizations, of a highly speculative nature as regards casualty figures.” The report makes 189 recommendations but relies on the military and police—the very forces that committed violations—to implement its recommendations. It has also been criticized for ignoring gender issues, only referencing the impact of conflict on women in relation to their missing husbands, fathers, and brothers, and rarely mentioning sexual abuse.",domestic,domestic law,President Mahinda Rajapaska,,,2010,2010-06-16,[https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025059/http://www.documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2010/PDF/Jun/1658\_19/1658\_19%20%28E%29.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025059/http:/www.documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2010/PDF/Jun/1658_19/1658_19%20%28E%29.pdf),completed,0,2010,,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,"February 21, 2002 and May 19, 2009",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,,[https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025059/http://www.documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2010/PDF/Jun/1658\_19/1658\_19%20%28E%29.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025059/http:/www.documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2010/PDF/Jun/1658_19/1658_19%20%28E%29.pdf) <https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/report-commission-inquiry-lessons-learnt-and-reconciliation>,not independent,Yes,9,"Named in the Proclamation, i.e. appointed by President Rajapaksa",No,Yes,,,[https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025059/http://www.documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2010/PDF/Jun/1658\_19/1658\_19%20%28E%29.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025059/http:/www.documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2010/PDF/Jun/1658_19/1658_19%20%28E%29.pdf) <https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/report-commission-inquiry-lessons-learnt-and-reconciliation> <https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11542053> <https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/39920374/failures-of-sri-lankas-llrc> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2011/09/sri-lanka-inquiry-armed-conflict-fundamentally-flawed/> <https://mfa.gov.lk/progress-in-implementing-llrc-proposals/> <https://sundaytimes.lk/120129/Columns/focus.html> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/asa370142011en.pdf>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,[https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025059/http://www.documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2010/PDF/Jun/1658\_19/1658\_19%20%28E%29.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025059/http:/www.documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2010/PDF/Jun/1658_19/1658_19%20%28E%29.pdf),Yes,6000,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025059/http://www.documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2010/PDF/Jun/1658_19/1658_19%20%28E%29.pdf https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/report-commission-inquiry-lessons-learnt-and-reconciliation,2011,Yes,"The LLRC published its own final report, tabled in Parliament on December 16, 2011.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,0,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,national day trilingual peace education special programs for women whose education was interrupted by the death or disappearance of the family’s breadwinner; ethnic affirmative action the implementation of past COIs; conduct a household survey of all affected families to ascertain the scale and circumstances of civilian casualties and damages; database with a list of detainees for public access; programs for LTTE combatant reintegration into civilian life; the rehabilitation of child combatants; increased employment opportunities for former child combatants; legal ownership of land of resettled IDPs; resettlement of Sri Lankan refugees in India; promotion of the multiethnic arts; multilingual national anthem,<https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/report-commission-inquiry-lessons-learnt-and-reconciliation>,No,[https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025059/http://www.documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2010/PDF/Jun/1658\_19/1658\_19%20%28E%29.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025059/http:/www.documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2010/PDF/Jun/1658_19/1658_19%20%28E%29.pdf),"Amarathunga, Harshadeva. “Omission of Gender: Sri Lanka’s ‘Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission.’” Peace Insight.

159,70,0,Commission for the Truth and Access to Justice in the Ayotzinapa Case,Comisión para la Verdad y Acceso a la Justicia en el caso Ayotzinapa (Commission for the Truth and Access to Justice in the Ayotzinapa Case),"After Mexico’s transition to democracy in 2000, the country elected a series of conservative and neoliberal presidents who responded to student, indigenous, labor, and peasant discontentment with increased militarization of the police and integration between the police and armed forces. This exacerbated the rise of drug trafficking and other organized crime due to the prevalence of deadly weapons available via corrupt or complicit state actors. The triple trends of political violence, state corruption, and organized crime has led to a crisis of enforced disappearances and other human rights abuses in Mexico that persists to this day, with almost 100,000 disappeared persons. This crisis came hurtling into international public eye with the disappearance of 43 students in rural Guerrero on September 26, 2014. Mexico has a policy of ‘Normal Schools,’ originally founded during the Mexican Revolution as a social justice effort to bring education to low-income students in isolated rural areas. They have been widely criticized by the private sector and Church as contrary to the public good because of their role in socialist and communist movements in Mexico. Many of the peasant and indigenous students who attend Normal Schools become teachers, and thus conservative interest groups in Mexico fear that this reproduces a culture of dissent and collectivism in rural areas. Students of ""Raúl Isidro Burgos” Normal School from Ayotzinapa planning to take buses to Mexico City to participate in a commemorative event of the student repression in 1968 were fired on by municipal police to prevent them from leaving the city, arrested, and forcibly disappeared. That night, the organized crime-paramilitary group Guerreros Unidos and police cooperated to terrorize the general civilian population and other students ultimately killing 6 and wounding 20 in addition to the 43 disappeared students. Massive protests followed, with this event “transcending public opinion in general, nationally and internationally, as one of the most serious violations to human rights in the recent history of [Mexico].” While the Attorney General conducted investigations and detained several individuals, who filed habeus corpus alleging that their confessions were inadmissible because they were obtained via the use of torture. In June 2018, a lower court ruled in favor of these possible perps, citing overwhelming evidence that the Attorney General’s Office conducted an investigation with multiple procedural irregularities and possibly obstructed justice. In this landmark ruling, the lower court ordered that a truth commission be created to determine the facts about the event and the cover up by the Attorney General’s Office. In response, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) established the Comisión para la Verdad y Acceso a la Justicia en el caso Ayotzinapa (Commission for the Truth and Access to Justice in the Ayotzinapa Case) through a Presidential Decree on December 4, 2018. Its mandate is specific to the events of September 26 and 27, 2014. Hence, this is not a post-conflict or post-authoritarian TC, but rather an event-specific post-atrocity TC. CoVAJ lacks significant powers, but can take testimony, conduct searches and seizures, and access official documents. Its composition is unusual; it is made up of representatives of the victims’ families, civil society representatives, and government ministers, presided over by the Undersecretary of Human Rights. This inclusion of partisan actors in addition to the fact that CoVAJ is contained within the Ministry of Interior indicates that it is not formally independent, although its activities so far have been free of scandal and seemingly impartial. The mandate also specifies a cooperation with other Federal Ministries as well as international bodies, including the IACHR and OHCHR-Mexico, in order to pool resources for investigation in anticipation for the establishment of a Special Prosecutor for the Ayotzinapa case. This Special Prosecutor was established in June 2019, only a few months after CoVAJ started formal operations. With AMLO’s blessing, the IACHR re-established el Grupo Interdisciplinario de Expertos Independientes (Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts), which has worked closely with CoVAJ to conduct forensic investigations and interview witnesses. While it is unclear whether CoVAJ will ultimately produce a final report, it has worked in conjunction with GIEI to produce an interim reports (the GIEI had already produced 2 reports prior to its disbandment in 2016). In the most recent report (April 2022), the GIEI and CoVAJ revealed evidence contrary to the Attorney General’s and other state institutions’ narrative of events. They found that the military was monitoring the students that night and had not shared relevant case files with CoVAJ despite a direct order from AMLO to do so; the Mexican navy was actively involved in the events and possibly planted bodybags at a site for the Attorney General to find and later use to reinforce their narrative of events; and the Attorney General’s Office and other investigators fabricated events and systematically used torture to extract (false?) evidence. The evidence and testimony for these findings is generally made public; in camera testimony and scanned documents regarding communications between perps and the armed forces are regularly released to media outlets and circulated for public consumption. AMLO has made it clear that all evidence that can be released while still retaining the integrity of the investigation and witness protection will be released. CoVAJ also does not have a set end date; presumably its mandate will be revoked when the Special Prosecutor has completed its trials.",hybrid,domestic law,Andrés Manuel López Obrador,,<https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5545622&fecha=04/12/2018#gsc.tab=0>,2018,2018-12-04,<https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5545622&fecha=04/12/2018#gsc.tab=0>,completed,0,2019,,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,no,yes,1,0,1,Yes,"September 26 and 27, 2014",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,43,"<https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5545622&fecha=04/12/2018#gsc.tab=0> <https://www.gob.mx/segob/es/articulos/comision-para-verdad-y-acceso-a-la-justicia-en-el-caso-ayotzinapa?idiom=es#:~:text=El%20prop%C3%B3sito%20de%20la%20CoVAJ,(Art%C3%ADculo%20Segundo%20del%20Decreto)>",partially independent,Yes,12,"The mandate states “that the composition of the Commission will be, at least, by the relatives of those affected or whoever they designate to represent them; a representative of the Secretaries of the Interior; of Foreign Relations, and of Finance and Public Credit, as well as by the professional and technical experts that are required and that are contracted with the resources with which the Commission is provided.” The appointment procedure is unknown.",Yes,Yes,,,"<https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5545622&fecha=04/12/2018#gsc.tab=0> <https://www.gob.mx/segob/es/articulos/comision-para-verdad-y-acceso-a-la-justicia-en-el-caso-ayotzinapa?idiom=es#:~:text=El%20prop%C3%B3sito%20de%20la%20CoVAJ,(Art%C3%ADculo%20Segundo%20del%20Decreto)>. <https://www.gob.mx/segob/prensa/alejandro-encinas-subsecretario-de-dh-poblacion-y-migracion-en-instalacion-de-la-comision-verdad-y-acceso-a-justicia-en-caso-ayotzinapa?idiom=es>",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"<https://www.gob.mx/segob/es/articulos/comision-para-verdad-y-acceso-a-la-justicia-en-el-caso-ayotzinapa?idiom=es#:~:text=El%20prop%C3%B3sito%20de%20la%20CoVAJ,(Art%C3%ADculo%20Segundo%20del%20Decreto)>.",Yes,,Yes,No,Yes,Unknown,,,https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/caso-ayotzinapa-difunden-dialogos-entre-policia-y-lider-de-guerreros-unidos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnOc7JsgfDY https://www.milenio.com/politica/comunidad/cndh-testimonio-pajarraco-encubre-ineficiencias-omisiones,,No,,,,,,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,No,<https://peoplesdispatch.org/2021/09/24/new-evidence-in-ayotzinapa-disappearance-case-contradicts-official-version/>,"Cázares, Jorge. “Ayotzinapa: The Rural Normal School and the Criminal Government Offensive.” The Brooklyn Rail, February 5, 2015. https://brooklynrail.org/2015/02/field-notes/ayotzinapa-the-rural-normal-school-and-the-criminal-government-offensive.

192,461,0,"the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission","Comisión Verité, Justice et Réconciliation (the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission)","Togo’s history has been long, complex, and violent. In 1961, after independence from France, Sylvanus Olympio became the first president but was deposed by a military coup in 1963 that precipitated his assassination under the direction of Sergeant Gnassingbé Eyadéma. The military handed power over to an interim president, who was soon deposed by the power-hungry Eyadéma in 1967, who ruled his one-party state with an iron fist until his death in 2005. His son, Faure Gnassingbé, immediately seized the presidency. This was an unconstitutional move, and in the uncertainty caused by this regime change, significant violence and political pressure forced Gnassingbé to resign and hold elections. During the campaign period, ethnic conflicts, socioeconomic cleavages, and traditional grievances caused parties to clash with each other and with state security forces, contributing to the death of 500 people and injury of thousands of others. In April 2005, Gnassingbé won an election condemned as unfree by some international observers, although others were notably silent on or accepting of the results. In the immediate aftermath of the 2005 election violence, Gnassingbé established the National Commission of Inquiry on the Presidential Election of April 24, 2005. This body, as well as the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, recommended the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission. Gnassingbé and opposition forces signed the Global Political Agreement in 2006, agreeing to end the political impasse and create a national unity government overseen by the OHCHR, UNDP, and EU. Multiple articles in the Global Political Agreement also call for a truth commission. The process of achieving this truth commission was remarkably consultative. At the request of the government, OHCHR conducted a national survey to determine which groups, time periods, and violations the people wanted to see investigated by the truth commission. Based on this consultation, Prime Minister Gilbet Houngbo enacted Decree 2009-46/PR on February 25, 2009, which established the le Comisión Verité, Justice et Réconciliation (the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission). The government then invited stakeholder representatives—civil society, students, professors, religious leads, traditional chiefs, etc.—to make suggestions about the commission’s structure and rank candidates for commissioners. Based on these lists, the council of ministers appointed 11 commissioners, chaired by Nicodème Barrigah-Bénissan. The CVJR was mandated to investigate “politically motivated violence and human rights violations,” which was interpreted broadly. It had narrow powers—it could not summon or subpoena, although it could access official documents by request. In its final report, published in 2012, the CVJR laments the lack of “incentives” for perpetrators to testify—few perpetrators willingly came forward, and of those that did, the commissioners doubted the truth of the testimony and questioned the genuine motive behind testifying. The CVJR further laments that it was established just before another election cycle. During 2009-2010, while it was supposed to be beginning preliminary investigations, the CVJR was meeting with political parties, incumbents, the military, and popular movements identified as potential spoilers in order to ensure that elections proceeded nonviolently. It even partnered with the National Electoral Commission to create a new code of conduct for political parties and mediated dialogue sessions. Its mandated activities did not begin in earnest until late 2010, when it established 8 regional offices and partnered with media and NGOs to conduct public awareness before taking testimony. In total, the CVJR took 22,415 testimonies, the highest numbers of which related to damage or destruction of property (4,249) and physical attacks (3,501). For specific, highly severe cases, the CVJR held 523 hearings, 425 of which were public, and 30 of which were recorded in camera. In its final report, the CVJR tackles responsibility on a case-by-case basis, addressing the different responsible parties in each relevant event since 1958. It is notable, however, that the CVJR lists a state security force as either directly responsible or complicit for nearly every event. The CVJR also names dozens of perpetrators who were directly implicated in testimony. It makes 68 recommendations, including a comprehensive reparations program, electoral reform, special attention to traditional chieftancies, judicial reform, ethnic equality, development projects to close the inequality gap, memorialization, and corruption reform. In 2014, Togo’s Council of Ministers submitted a draft white paper to the President urging implementation.

112,160,0,National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons,"Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas (CONADEP), National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons","La Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas (CONADEP) was established by President Raúl Alfonsín to investigate the pattern of abduction, disappearance, torture, and other human rights violations (murder, rape, extortion, looting) during the March 1976-October 1983 military junta known as the National Reorganization Process and the subsequent Guerra Sucia, or Dirty War. CONADEP was created and empowered on December 15, 1983 by Presidential Decree No. 187/83 with a restricted mandate of only 9 months without the possibility of extension. Its specified period of investigation was between 1976-83. It was tasked with a general fact-finding mission to determine historical truths for victims of violence, the disappeared, and their families. CONADEP also aimed to locate as many of the still alive disappeared as possible, although this goal proved futile. The Presidential Decree proposed 13 commissioners, with 10 appointed by the executive and 3 nominated by the legislative Chamber of Deputies, all on the basis of merit. The elected President of CONADEP was Ernesto Sabato. CONADEP generated great public enthusiasm and cooperation, with perpetrators, victims, and witnesses all willing to testify. Due to public demand, CONADEP expanded its staff and began traveling to remote provinces of Argentina to meet with individuals wishing to testify who could not travel. Furthermore, because many of the families of disappeared or threatened had fled the country, CONADEP granted permission to Argentinian embassies and diplomats to take depositions abroad. Ultimately, CONADEP gathered more than 14,000 depositions regarding human rights violations and disappearances. CONADEP was also granted access to confidential military and governmental documents from the military junta. That being said, CONADEP had extremely limited powers to compel and did not have the right to determine guilt or innocence. Their findings relating to responsibility were meant to be turned over to the prosecutor confidentially, but in the process the names of perpetrators were leaked and ultimately published. When CONADEP concluded September 20, 1984, it published its full report in addition to a shorter, more accessible report Nunca Más: Informe de la Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas, which is widely available in hard copy and online. The report found that 8,960 individuals were forcibly disappeared and that the practices of torturing, extrajudicial detention in secret detention facilities, and the disposal of bodies in unknown sites, sometimes mass graves, were systematic. The report emphasizes that the highest levels of military command planned and issued repressive practices. However, the former President General Renaldo ordered the military documentation that would prove responsibility within the chain-of-command to be destroyed. Finally, CONADEP recommends the creation of a reparations program for families of the disappeared, judicial reform, judicial urgency towards the prosecution of perpetrators, and mandatory human rights education in military and public schools.",domestic,domestic law,Raúl Alfonsín,,CONADEP report and USIP mandate,1983,1983-12-15,https://www.usip.org/publications/1983/12/truth-commission-argentina,completed,0,1983,CONADEP report,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,1976-83,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,CONADEP Report,fully independent,Yes,13,"10 appointed by the President and 3 appointed by the Chamber of Deputies, all based on merit",No,Yes,60,,,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,CONADEP Report,Yes,14000,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,http://www.jus.gob.ar/media/2986944/cuadernillo_01_web.pdf https://www.academia.edu/7749124/The_National_Commission_on_the_Disappearance_of_Persons_Contributions_to_Transitional_Justice,1984,Yes,Farrar Straus & Giroux published the 1st edition in Spanish; English versions published by Farrar Straus & Giroux as well as Faber and Faber,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,0,,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,Support non-governmental national and international human rights organizations,CONADEP Report,No,,"UNHRC. “Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence, Pablo de Greiff.” Koninklijke Brill NV.

198,101,0,"the Commission for Truth, Justice, Peace, and Public Tranquility","la Comisión de Verdad, Justicia, Paz, y Tranquilidad Pública, COVEJUSPAZ (the Commission for Truth, Justice, Peace, and Public Tranquility)","In 1989, massive state debt, structural adjustment, and the high cost of living prompted the violent events of the Caracazo riots, which spelled the beginning of the end for Venezuela’s democratic pact, known as puntofijismo. In 1992, the Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement, led by Hugo Chávez, conducted two coup attempts. Chávez was arrested, but the Bolivarians continued to gain significant traction among the poor, marginalized, and even middle classes. In 1993, in an effort to reconcile with the Bolivarian’s growing numbers, President Rafael Caldera pardoned Chávez, but this only strengthened the social and political will behind the Movement. Chávez won the 1998 elections. His first term was relatively successful; a massive anti-poverty and development campaign improved the cost and quality of living and the 1999 constitution enshrined socioeconomic guarantees. He was reelected in 2000. But by 2002, opposition to Chávez was high—especially from previous elites in the oil sector. PDVSA, the oil labor union, and various media outlets fomented and conducted a coup that displaced Chávez for three days and dissolved the National Assembly (AN). After the Presidency was restored, PDVSA conducted months-long strikes, deteriorating public opinion of Chávez as oil revenues halted. In the period between 2005-2012, Chávez made successive power grabs—immobilizing veto players, defeating a recall referendum, discriminating against opposition members, and extending his term limit “for at least a decade.” Distrustful of his own party, he created another, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). Arms and drug trafficking increased, as did militarization. In 2012, Chávez died of cancer. The 2013 elections were tense and closely contested, but Chávez’s handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, won the Presidency with barely 51%. Maduro’s regime accelerated Venezuela’s descent into authoritarianism. In 2014, security forces arrested opposition leader Leopoldo López on trumped-up charges of fomenting unrest, prompting massive protests known as the guarimbas, the ‘exit’. In the 2015 gubernatorial elections, the opposition party, the Democratic Roundtable (MUD), won a majority in the AN and denounced Maduro, but the PSUV-controlled Supreme Court ruled that it would take over legislative functions since the AN had been “compromised.” This obviously unconstitutional power grab prompted months-long protests that left over 100 dead, prompting Maduro to hold a referendum for a new constitution. Since the opposition boycotted the referendum, it easily passed. The National Constituent Assembly (ANC) was formed to draft this constitution, and, within a month, the Supreme Court had endowed it with legislative power. There are now two legislatures in Venezuela: the constitutional AN, which holds no real power, and the unconstitutional ANC, which holds all the power. In 2019, talks between the opposition and PSUV were spoiled by the little-known opposition figure Juan Guaído, who assumed leadership of the AN and ran with it. The Maduro regime has created a number of commissions to legitimize its power, including la Comisión de Verdad, Justicia, Paz, y Tranquilidad Pública, COVEJUSPAZ (the Commission for Truth, Justice, Peace, and Public Tranquility). Extraordinary Law No. 6.323 was enacted by the ANC on August 8, 2017, immediately after the constitutional crisis, and empowered the COVEJUSPAZ with incredibly broad powers. These include the power to compel testimony and documents with the support of the Attorney General (a commissioner) to execute summons and subpoenas. Its mandate is focused on “violence for political reasons and intolerance, as well as the related criminal dynamics,” from 1999-2017. But the COVEJUSPAZ, which is ongoing, is focused not on the hundreds of thousands of victims who have been abused and displaced by state violence, but rather targets opposition leaders to ensure that they are not promoting any “hate or intolerance,” a rhetorical way to say “pro-democracy sentiment.” This is evident from the pronounced topics before the COVEJUSPAZ. It focuses on the “destabilizing plans promoted by Julio Borges,” a former speaker of the National Assembly and opposition leader who has promoted democratic transition; the socioeconomic decline of Venezuela; the “violence and terror generated by opposition groups… led by Freddy Guevara,” another opposition leader promoting democratic transition, who was incidentally arrested in 2021; and the “network of corruption and extortion” of former attorney general Luisa Ortega Diaz, who was illegally fired after refusing to execute arrest warrants for various opposition leaders and publicly denouncing Maduro’s invasion of the justice system. The COVEJUSPAZ also investigated candidates running for the gubernatorial and municipal elections in 2017 to ensure that none were involved in the anti-government pro-democracy protests. Delcy Rodriguez stressed that this would have a “cleansing effect” on Venezuela’s politics. The COVEJUSPAZ completely lacks independence. The Extraordinary Law dictates that it is an organ of the state, subordinate to the ANC’s oversight. Further, the commissioners are all supporters of Maduro’s regime, including its President, Delcy Rodriguez, who is currently the Executive Vice President to Maduro and who at the time of COVEJUSPAZ’s initiation was the Foreign Minister and the Chair of the ANC. Clearly, she is not an impartial or neutral commissioner. News reports indicate that after 2019, Attorney General Tarek William Saab took over as President—Saab took over after Luisa Ortega Diaz was fired and has been credited with further decaying the justice system. Other commissioners supposedly include “opposition” and “victims representatives,” but the opposition representatives are in the pocket of PSUV, and the victims represented are former militants also sympathetic to PSUV, rather than the everyday people victimized by the Maduro regime. In interviews with the UNOHCHR, not a single civil society representative or victim’s family said that they trusted the COVEJUSPAZ. Transparency Venezuela calls it a “revenge commission” that seeks to persecute the genuine opposition (not the “opposition” represented in the COVEJUSPAZ commissioners) and perpetuate impunity for the ruling PSUV.",domestic,domestic law,The National Constituent Assembly under Chair Delcy Rodriguez and President Nicolás Maduro,,,2017,2017-08-08,<https://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/storage/documentos/leyes/ley-constitucional-de-la-comision-para-la-verdad-la-justicia-la-paz-y-la-tranquilidad-publica-20220214233811.pdf>,ongoing,0,2017,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,yes,no,0,1,1,Yes,"1999-2017, extended to 1999-2019",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,,<https://justiciatransicional.org.ve/comisiones-de-la-verdad-caso-venezuela-en-que-se-fallo-por-milagros-betancourt-c/> <https://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/storage/documentos/leyes/ley-constitucional-de-la-comision-para-la-verdad-la-justicia-la-paz-y-la-tranquilidad-publica-20220214233811.pdf>,not independent,Yes,14,"The Extraordinary Law dictates that the commissioners were appointed by the ANC; 3 were ANC members; 3 were representatives of “organizations for the victims of political violence in the period 1999-2017”; a member of a human rights organization; 2 people chosen for their “professional capacity, ethics, and personal integrity”; the Attorney General; 3 ANC deputies of the “opposition”.",Yes,Yes,,,<https://www.csis.org/analysis/venezuelan-truth-commission> <https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Countries/VE/VenezuelaReport2018_EN.pdf> <https://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/storage/documentos/leyes/ley-constitucional-de-la-comision-para-la-verdad-la-justicia-la-paz-y-la-tranquilidad-publica-20220214233811.pdf>,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,<https://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/storage/documentos/leyes/ley-constitucional-de-la-comision-para-la-verdad-la-justicia-la-paz-y-la-tranquilidad-publica-20220214233811.pdf>,Unknown,,No,Unknown,Yes,Unknown,,,https://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/storage/documentos/leyes/ley-constitucional-de-la-comision-para-la-verdad-la-justicia-la-paz-y-la-tranquilidad-publica-20220214233811.pdf,,No,,,,,,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,Yes,<https://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/storage/documentos/leyes/ley-constitucional-de-la-comision-para-la-verdad-la-justicia-la-paz-y-la-tranquilidad-publica-20220214233811.pdf>,"Bronstein, Hugh. “Venezuela’s Socialist-Run ‘truth Commission’ to Investigate Opposition.” Reuters, August 16, 2017, sec.

125,155,0,Historical Truth and New Deal Commission,Comisión de la Verdad Histórica y Nuevo Trato con los Pueblos Indígenas (Historical Truth and New Deal Commission),"There are 10 different Indigenous nations in Chile. The largest is the Mapuche, followed by the Aymara, the Diaguita, the Lickanantay, and the Quechua peoples. Chile is the only country in Latin America that does not recognize the Indigenous Peoples in its constitution, despite a massive Mapuche mobilization movement since the 1980s. This movement gained traction during former President Patricio Aylwin’s administration, leading to the Nueva Imperial Acuerdo, in which Aylwin committed to creaing the National Corporation for Indigenous Development, the Special Commission of Indigenous People, and the National Fund for Ethnodevelopment as public entities aimed at promoting the material and cultural development of Indigenous Peoples. In 1990, Aylwin followed through on the Special Commission of Indigenous People, which drafted a law codifying the various nation’s demands. After some debate and negotiation, the bill was endorsed by Aylwin and sent to the National Congress in 1991. Within the two years it remained in Congress, the bill was significantly watered down, but nonetheless retained its original intentions. Law No. 19,253 on the Protection, Promotion and Development of Indigenous Peoples, and the creation of the National Corporation for Indigenous Development (CONADI) was passed in 1993 as the “Indigenous Law”. While it was a step in the right direction, the law used up all of the political will for the protection of Indigenous Peoples. The next year, President Aylwin drafted a Reform Project to the Constitution ratifying ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples to the Congress. It was rejected multiple times before the Congress finally passed the Convention 169 without reforming the Constitution 17 years later in 2008. To date, the Constitution of 1980, which is leftover from dictator Augusto Pinochet, does not recognize Chile’s Indigenous Peoples. However, political instability and anti-government protest movements in the late 2010 ultimately led to overwhelming support for the drafting of a new constitution. A total rejection of the status quo led by students, Indigenous Peoples, and the public sector resulted in the collapse of the traditional parties and the rise of underdog President Gabriel Borić. The new draft constitution not only recognizes Indigenous Peoples, but incorporates a multi-level scheme of collective rights and protects ecological and environmental integrity. It will be voted on by referendum on September 4, 2022. Since the 1980s, however, the Indigenous movements have only grown stronger and louder. Aylwin recognized this initially, and his successor, President Ricardo Lagos, continued attempts at dialogue with the Indigenous Peoples. Lagos enacted Supreme Decree No. 19 on 18 January 2001, which created la Comisión de la Verdad Histórica y Nuevo Trato con los Pueblos Indígenas (Historical Truth and New Deal Commission). Its goal was to promote dialogue and coexistence in preparation for a “new deal” through a joint government-Indigenous Peoples investigation of the history between the Indigenous Peoples and the Chilean State. In reviewing this history, the Commission also recognized the systematic violations of Indigenous Peoples’ civil and political and economic, social, and cultural rights promoted by past and current government policies. The Commission was headed by former President Aylwin, who presided over 25 other commissioners, mainly non-Indigenous historical experts, Indigenous people and/or representatives, and legal scholars. The commission was decentralized into local and municipal subcommissions in addition to Indigenous nation-specific subcommissions, which were staffed almost exclusively by Indigenous people and descendants in order to facilitate a sense of ownership over the Commission’s goals and work product. The Final Report was published in October 2003 by the government, National Library, and the Patricio Aylwin Foundation. It has been widely disseminated and reproduced. The Commisison’s main conclusion was that Indigenous Peoples have been the victims of atrocities for centuries and that the State has a responsibility to correct their historical invisibility, recognize their identity, and repair the damage that has systematically been inflicted on them through cultural preservation. The final report emphasizes that the state is “indebted” to the Indigenous Peoples. It makes recommendations, largely for Indigenous political, electoral, territorial, and cultural rights to be enshrined in the constitution or be given special legal status, for Convention 169 to be ratified, for a greater social safety net to be extended to Indigenous Peoples and their descendants, and for intercultural education and memorialization. In many ways, however, the final report is not as damning of the Chilean State as it could be—it shifts blame onto conquistadores and colonial dynamics for the bulk of violence towards Indigenous Peoples. It finds that the Chilean State committed violence against the Indigenous through forced and violent assimilation because, at the time, the state was focused on a political project of nation-building to create a loyal and homogenous citizenry. While it condemns this logic, the fact that it even offers a justification was criticized by Indigenous readers and even commissioners themselves. In fact, the coordinator of one of the Commission’s many “Working Groups,” in this case on Economic and Social Development, Philip Larrain, wrote a desenting opinion after refusing to sign the final report. He claimed that some of the conclusions and recommendations of the Commission could exacerbate preexisting tensions and tend towards separation rather than integration.",domestic,domestic law,President Ricardo Lagos,,<https://bibliotecadigital.indh.cl/bitstream/handle/123456789/268/nuevo-trato-indigena.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>,2001,2001-07-18,<https://bibliotecadigital.indh.cl/bitstream/handle/123456789/268/nuevo-trato-indigena.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>,completed,0,2001,<https://bibliotecadigital.indh.cl/bitstream/handle/123456789/268/nuevo-trato-indigena.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,no,yes,0,1,1,No,,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,,<https://bibliotecadigital.indh.cl/bitstream/handle/123456789/268/nuevo-trato-indigena.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>,fully independent,Yes,25,"Named in Supreme Decree No. 19, i.e. appointed by President Lagos",Yes,Yes,250,,<https://www.cepchile.cl/cep/site/artic/20160304/asocfile/20160304093138/rev92_larrain.pdf> <https://bibliotecadigital.indh.cl/bitstream/handle/123456789/268/nuevo-trato-indigena.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://bibliotecadigital.indh.cl/bitstream/handle/123456789/268/nuevo-trato-indigena.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>,No,,No,No,No,No,,,https://bibliotecadigital.indh.cl/bitstream/handle/123456789/268/nuevo-trato-indigena.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,2003,Yes,"The Commission itself published its report, which was reproduced by media outlets and other organizations.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,0,,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,"environmental protections, especially those related to the economic and cultural development of the Indigenous Peoples; damage compensation should territory or environment be damaged; impact-benefit agreements for private investment; minimum standards for investors in respect for environmental, social, and economic rights of Indigenous Peoples; a research entity that promotes and publishes Indigenous history and current reality; the Institute for Investigation and Promotion of Indigenous Peoples for education and methodology to improve the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of policies aimed at Indigenous Peoples; public officials Indigenous sensitization training; a special census to identify the direct descendants of the Kawésqar and Yagán Peoples, who are nearing extinction, and enables those members to reconnect with their ancestry and access initiatives for the survival of their culture",<https://bibliotecadigital.indh.cl/bitstream/handle/123456789/268/nuevo-trato-indigena.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>,No,<https://bibliotecadigital.indh.cl/bitstream/handle/123456789/268/nuevo-trato-indigena.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y> <https://unpo.org/article/17393> <https://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/12/5799/5.pdf>,"Larraín, Felipe. “COMISIÓN DE VERDAD HISTÓRICA Y NUEVO TRATO: OPINIÓN DE MINORÍA.” Estudios Públicos 92 (2003): 14.

220,780,0,All-Island Commission of Inquiry into the Involuntary Removal or Disappearance of Persons,Commission of Inquiry into Involuntary Removal and Disappearance of Certain Persons (All Island),"In July 1983, an attack on government troops by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) sparked riots in Colombo and elsewhere causing several hundred Tamil deaths, now referred to as Black July. The ensuing civil war between the government and the LTTE has been marked by gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by both sides, and has claimed over 60,000 lives. The LTTE, in its struggle for an independent Tamil state, has been responsible for untold human rights abuses. It has repeatedly targeted civilians in its military operations, and assassinated leaders and members of rival Tamil parties, journalists, and human rights activists. The LTTE has engaged in massacres, retaliatory killings, and “ethnic cleansing” of Sinhalese and Muslim villagers. Since the late 1980s, the LTTE has controlled significant areas of north and east Sri Lanka, collecting “taxes” and administering justice. It has imprisoned, tortured, and executed thousands of Tamil dissidents and their family members. In areas under its control the LTTE tolerates no freedom of expression, association, or assembly, and it has recruited thousands of children for use as soldiers, many of whom have died in combat. Government security forces have likewise been responsible for numerous serious violations throughout the two decades of fighting. The Sri Lankan armed forces have carried out massacres of Tamil civilians and engaged in indiscriminate aerial and artillery bombardment of populated areas, including medical facilities and places of worship where civilians have taken refuge. Suspected sympathizers with the LTTE and other Tamil groups have been subject to mass arrests, prolonged detention without trial, torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial executions. Government forces have displaced hundreds of thousands of Tamil civilians, often in an apparent attempt to deprive the LTTE of local support. For 20 years the civil war was punctuated by large-scale and bloody military operations, short-lived ceasefires, and the 32-month presence in the late 1980s of an Indian Peace Keeping Force. Between 1983 and mid-1987, Amnesty International documented at least 680 cases of “disappearances” committed in the north and east in the context of the escalating armed conflict between the security forces and militant Tamil groups.5 Another 43 cases were reported to the organization from mid-1987 to 1989, when the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was responsible for security in the north under the terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord In the 1994 parliamentary elections, the UNP lost power to the opposition People's Alliance (PA). The new PA government established three commissions of inquiry to investigate the fate of the tens of thousands of people who had ""disappeared"" in Sri Lanka since January 1, 1988. The commissions found evidence of ""disappearance"" in 16,742 cases, though thousands of additional cases remained to be investigated when the commissions finished their work. A fourth commission was established in 1998 and worked for two years, investigating the cases that the first three commissions had not examined. According to its report of March 2001, the fourth commission found evidence of a further 4,473 ""disappearances,"" thus bringing the total number of ""disappearances"" to 21,215. The majority of these ""disappearances"" took place in connection with the JVP uprising and not the ethnic conflict with the LTTE",domestic,domestic law,President Chandrika Kumaratunga,,<https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/srilanka0308/2.htm> <https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4b6fe29113.pdf>,1998,1998-04-30,<http://www.disappearances.org/mainfile.php/frep_sl_ai/> (but it is not accessible),completed,0,,<https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4b6fe29113.pdf>,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,,,0,1,1,Yes,1983-1998,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16742,https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4b6fe29113.pdf,don't know,Yes,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,<https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4b6fe29113.pdf>,Unknown,,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,,,,2000,Yes,The Commission itself,No,,,,Unknown,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,<https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4b6fe29113.pdf>,,,https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4b6fe29113.pdf https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/srilanka0308/2.htm,0,,,,,,,executive,prevention of human rights violations; responsibility; historial truth; accountability; non-recurrence,,,,,,,352; 313,776; 777; 674,2024-01-25
151,367,0,the Presidential Commission of the Historians,Vēsturnieku Komisija (the Presidential Commission of the Historians),"The Baltic experience of WWII was highly unlike the rest of the world, and particularly the rest of Europe. In 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, dividing up the Baltics into spheres of influence after years of rising tensions. Latvia was assigned to the Soviets, resulting in occupation by the Red Army and the creation of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic (LSSR). Latvia was rapidly Sovietized; political parties were banned, mass deportations, detentions, and forced drafting targeted “enemies of the people,” and private property was stolen from farmers and peasants. Furthermore, this was under Stalin, so forced collectivization resulted in starvation and poverty. When Nazi Germany invaded in 1941, many ethnic Latvians supported it, willingly forming ethnic Latvian paramilitaries and Auxiliary Police units to assist the Nazis in various ethnic cleansing and territorial conquest activities. Latvia was also the location of a large amount of concentration camps; in 1941, the Nazi regime deported thousands of Jews to the Riga ghetto in Latvia and over the course of the Holocaust, it is estimated that 30,000 Jews were murdered in Latvia. Of the 95,000 Jews living in Latvia before the Holocaust, only about a hundred remained in 1944. Although Nazi occupation may have meant death for ethnic minorities, for many ethnic Latvians it represented a “reprieve from deportation if not outright liberation.” Compared to the Soviets, many ethnic Latvians were content with their private property restored under Nazi occupation. In this way, the Western narrative of WWII is largely irrelevant to Latvian. When the Soviets reestablished control in 1944, forced conscription into the Red Army was thus met with heavy resistance. Some Latvian revolutionaries turned to guerilla tactics, forming the Latvian national partisans to fight against occupation, prompting the Soviets to double down on repression. In addition to collectivization, in 1949, the Soviets deported 43,000 kulaks (rural poor) and nationalists to Siberia and labor camps, where thousands were forced into slavery, died, or were executed. After the death of Stalin in 1953, Soviet policies relaxed considerably, and independence movements amplified throughout the 1980s as the USSR’s power began to slip in the Cold War. With glasnost and perestroika, Latvian resistance grew into the Popular Front of Latvia, an anti-Soviet nationalist political coalition. Although the USSR Supreme Court granted Latvia provisional independence in 1990, the transitional government did not end until 1991 and elections weren’t held until 1993. In 1993, Guntis Ulmanis was elected President. Due to the competing narratives within and outside of Latvia about the Baltic experience under German and Soviet totalitarianism, Ulmanis was eager to establish an official historical record, recognize crimes against humanity, and make the international community and Latvian public aware of the truth. Thus, he established the Presidential Commission of Historians in 1998, which was regulated by Cabinet of Ministers Regulations No. 014 of 4 May 1999. The Commission was originally intended as a “proper” truth commission—its mandate was limited, and its goal was a final report. However, it lacked a clear demarcation of tasks, and as its research continued to grow in scope and notoriety, it became a semi-permanent commission more akin to an executive advisory body. Its mandate was never formally altered to reflect this change. Initially, it had four main research focuses: on crimes against humanity during Soviet occupation 1940-41, the Holocaust 1941-44, crimes against humanity during German occupation 1941-44, crimes against humanity during Soviet occupation 1944-56. These focuses have broadened, and the Commission continues today. It has produced in total 29 reports. The Commission was made up of 23 national and international commissioners. The Latvian commissioners were historians and professors, while the international commissioners were political activists, human rights organization representatives, Jewish, German, and Russian representatives, and UN diplomats. The bulk of the Commission’s reporting was carried out by a staff of 25 professional historians, but crafting the report was not the bulk of the Commission’s work. The bipolar structure of the Commission allowed it to hold international conferences and discussion forums with international political actors, diplomats, and civil society to foster academic change as well as work in cooperation with national institutions. In particular, the Commission made significant efforts to collaborate with government ministries, including the Ministry of Education and the Association of Latvian Teachers of History, to reflect on how the Commission’s findings could be implemented in classroom curriculum. In general, the Commission attempted to generate political change through ongoing dialogue; it was as much discourse-oriented as it was historical-fact-oriented. Commissioners, while asked to be independent, were not apolitical—they actively called out Russia for “still refusing to admit not only the fact of occupation itself, but also the fact that the Soviet regime committed crimes against humanity.” Commissioners also called out the international community for failing to hold Russia accountable. The bipolar structure and work of the Commission was ultimately reflected in its report, which is a mix of formal historical scholarship and political commentary. While the Commission succeeded in sparking dialogue, this was not always an advantage; the biggest criticism levied against the Commission was that it “[spoke] with many voices… there [was] no unified version of the past.” Another criticism relates to the Commission’s definition of the crimes it investigated. It explicitly references crimes against humanity, like other Baltic truth commissions, but it is the only Baltic truth commission to use the term “genocide” to describe Soviet crimes against ethnic Latvians. Critics note that it uses this term without clearly defining its statutory requirements, or even contextual meaning, in a potentially misleading way.",hybrid,domestic law,President Guntis Ulmanis,,<http://lpra.vip.lv/komisija.htm>,1998,1998-11-13,,completed,0,1998,<http://lpra.vip.lv/komisija.htm> <https://www.president.lv/lv/vesturnieku-komisija>,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,0,1,Yes,1940-991,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,,<http://lpra.vip.lv/komisija.htm> <https://www.president.lv/lv/jaunums/valsts-prezidents-latvijas-vesturnieku-komisijas-starptautiskaja-konference-jaizverte-musu-pagatne-lai-veidotu-labaku-nakotni> <https://likumi.lv/ta/id/24155-vesturnieku-komisijas-nolikums>,partially independent,Yes,23,Appointed by President,Yes,Yes,190,,<http://lpra.vip.lv/komisija.htm> <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01629770701223619?needAccess=true> <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01629778.2014.937905?needAccess=true>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,<https://likumi.lv/ta/id/24155-vesturnieku-komisijas-nolikums>,No,,No,No,No,No,,,https://www.president.lv/lv/vesturnieku-komisija,2005,Yes,"The Commission published 29 volumes in total, 1999-present.

113,692,0,Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry,اللجنة البحرينية المستقلة لتقصي Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI),"In February 2011, inspired by the apparent successes of Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, thousands of Bharani protestors stormed the capital, Manama, with mass demonstrations that ultimately spread to the entire country. Protestors condemned institutionalized discrimination against the Shi’a Muslim majority and the tight grip on power maintained by the Al Khalifa monarchy. In 2001, the referendum-approved National Action Charter promised key democratic reforms including a popularly elected National Assembly, but only produced limited, superficial reform, prompting the Al Khalifa monarchy to double down on its repressive past. The patterns of repression exercised by the Al Khalifa regime to suppress political dissent include forced disappearance, censorship of the opposition, illegal detention of political activists and opposition members, and torture while in detention. Each of these patterns were exacerbated during the February-March 2011 protests, in which police and armed forces brutality via lethal force against protestors was routine, thousands of protestors were arrested without charge, and denial of basic human rights was systematic. As the Al Khalifa monarchy agreed to reforms, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa signed Royal Order No. 28, creating the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry to investigate allegations of human rights violations during February-March 2011. BICI was empowered to take (but not compel) testimony, access government documents, and investigate state agents. It featured 5 international commissioners, none of whom were Bahraini, chosen for their transitional justice experience. BICI began investigation July 20, 2011 and initially received 8,110 complaints and statements of various human rights abuses. In order to address these complaints, BICI conducted 5,188 interviews to collect witness testimony and traveled across Bahrain to take testimony and view evidence, including 65 primary site visits with follow-up visits. BICI concluded that there was pervasive use of torture in detention, that security forces committed gross human rights violations, including but not limited to the use of electro-shock devices, beatings, sleep deprivation, sexual abuse, hanging, solitary confinement, and other humiliation and degradation, that the judicial and prosecutorial apparatus often unfairly supported security forces’ abuse, and that the government destroyed Shi’a religious sites and routinely limited the freedom of expression of opposition, including student organizations. To remedy these abuses, BICI recommends reparations to individuals and families, an extensive training program for security forces on the use of force, several changes to the criminal code and prosecutorial system relating to torture and forced detainment, including shifting the burden of proof onto the state, universal education about human rights, a relaxation of censorship and protection of freedom of political and religious expression, and the establishment of a separate independent body capable of prosecuting security forces for violations in February/March 2011 as the judicial system is reformed. BICI further cooperated with the government and Royal Court to facilitate “immediate intervention” in some particularly pressing areas of humanitarian concern, including the release of more than 300 detainees, medical attention to injured persons, dropping of criminal charges against medical personnel, and reinstatement of hundreds of fired public sector employees and suspended students. BICI was entirely independent of the Government of Bahrain, but this may ultimately have acted against victims’ benefit. While it is excellent that no government or administrative body could have interfered in BICI and BICI was entirely free to make its own decisions about internal processes, scope, and methods, it is widely accepted that the Al Khalifa regime used BICI as a public relations stunt. The idea of BICI was proposed amid considerable conflict and was well received by the public, prompting Al Khalifa to enact BICI as a strategy to deflate domestic political tension and evade international repercussions and condemnation in light of its mass repression of opposition. Hence, Al Khalifa’s commitment to BICI was entirely a façade. So, while BICI undertook significant investigation of the police, armed forced, and judicial system and made substantial recommendations, the fact that only very limited prosecution of perpetrators, reform, and execution of recommendations was achieved makes BICI largely futile. This is further demonstrated by the fact that the Government of Bahrain has only implemented 5 out of 26 of BICI’s recommendations and continues to commit with indemnity human rights abuses at a level as high if not higher than during the 2011 uprising.",hybrid,domestic law,King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa,,<https://www.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf>,2011,2011-06-29,https://www.peaceagreements.org/viewmasterdocument/1414,completed,0,2011,<https://www.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf>,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,February-March 2011,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,,<https://www.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf>,fully independent,Yes,5,“selected on the basis of their investigatory and judicial experience”,No,Yes,,,<https://www.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,<https://www.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf>,Yes,,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,https://www.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf,2011,Yes,"BICI’s website, https://www.bici.org.bh/, then more than 2,000 print versions distributed by BICI",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,1,Security forces. “Government of Bahrain should conduct effective investigations into all the deaths that have been attributed to the security forces”,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,"Due to the extensivity of the pattern of torture in detention, BICI recommends the creation of an additional independent and impartial body to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of torture.

122,482,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Commission Verité et Réconciliation (Truth and Reconciliation Commission),"Before the Central African Republic was granted provisional independence from France in 1958, Barthélémy Boganda, an anti-colonialist who spoke out against racism, was the first African to be elected to the all-French government. He went on to establish a political party (MESAN) that captured a majority of votes in the 1957 election but died in a plane crash before formal independence in 1960. His cousin, David Dacko, forced political opponents into exile, banned all political parties other than MESAN, and led a totalitarian regime until a coup staged by Jean-Bédel Boukassa on New Year’s Eve 1965. Boukassa declared himself Emperor, pillaged the nation’s natural resources, trafficked arms, and conducted a massive corruption ring. With the help of the French Army, Dacko regained the presidency in a 1981 coup, but was overthrown in 1981 by General André Kolingba. Kolingba led a military junta but legalized political parties and allowed for semi-free parliamentary elections, although massive violence campaigns were orchestrated against opponents with any chance of success. This seeming willingness to reform in addition to the decline of the Soviet Union and pressure from the international community led to a pro-democracy movement. Despite the free and fair election of President Patassé, violence in the CAR increased; Kolingba’s supporters alleged that the government was conducting a “witch hunt” against them, corruption was rampant, and three consecutive mutinies generated ethnic conflict 1996-7. At this time, armed groups began controlling territory, signaling the civil war to come. President Patassé likely exacerbated this by contracting Congolese and Libyan soldiers. In 2003, a rebel leader, Françoise Bozizé, staged a coup, creating a multi-party, opposition-inclusive National Assembly and hosting the National Reconciliation Forum. But in 2004, rebel and guerilla forces, most notably the FPDC, CPJP, and UFDR, began attacking the state in what has been called a ‘Bush War’, again leading to French involvement in defense of Bozizé. Conflict is ongoing in CAR. Prior to the Bush War, Bozizé initiated the National Recociliation Forum, a conference held with 350 delegates from all political, social, religious and professional affiliations of CAR as well as 30 international guests. General information about the Forum is available on its website, at http://dialogue.national.free.fr/dn_commissions.htm. Interestingly, the Forum was the brainchild of Patassé, not Bozizé, but Patassé was excluded from the Forum by the National Transitional Council, which accused him of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and embezzlement. The Forum was the parent institution to several subcommissions, including the Commission Verité et Réconciliation (CVR, Truth and Reconciliation Commission) among other commissions on political and diplomatic issues, defense and security; economy and finances; and educational, social and cultural matters. The Forum occurred after Bozizé announced that a constitutional referendum would be held in 2004, with parliamentary, municipal, and presidential elections planned for later that year. He claimed that “the ultimate goal of the [Forum] dialogue is to ensure the return to a constitutional democracy within a realistic timeframe.” The CVR was ostensibly intended to further this goal by “establishing a precise account of the facts that have plagued Central African society from the 1960s to the present day” and “promoting understanding and genuine national reconciliation.” However, the CVR was granted only six weeks to complete its work, was given no power to compel testimony or the production of documents and had limited technical capacity. It really had no investigation power—it relied on documents provided by the state, only 8 interviews, and had no power to comment on serious human rights violations committed by security forces loyal to Bozizé. Although it lists a comprehensive number of human rights violations committed by past regimes and by Bozizé’s forces, the CVR recognizes them and then never discusses them again or investigates them in any meaningful way. The CVR mostly furthers to Bozizé’s request for forgiveness for the “excesses” of the coup. So, despite its de jure good intentions, the CVR was de facto a façade to espouse rhetoric to legitimize Bozizé’s newborn regime in the face of domestic and international criticism. The entire Forum was under the direct supervision of the executive. This is reflected in the institutional structure of the CVR. Its 6 commissioners were chaired by André Denmasse Kette was an active leader of the National Democratic Front (FND), which merged with the National Convergence “Kwa Na Ka” (KNK), a party specifically created in support of Bozizé in the 2005 elections. So, Kette was clearly a voice of endorsement for Bozizé himself as well as the state narratives whitewashing Bozizé’s coup. Since he was a politician himself, Kette also had personal career interests in the success of Bozizé’s government. Nonetheless, the CVR produced a final report that identified the causes of past conflict with considerable accuracy and made significant recommendations. It interviewed significant perpetrators, including the commander of the Army under Patassé, former President David Dacko, electoral officials, and the son of former President Bokassa.

116,346,0,Commission for Investigation of the Events in and around Srebrenica between 10 and 19 July 1995,Commission for Investigation of the Events in and around Srebrenica between 10 and 19 July 1995,"The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) was established in 1918, federalizing an ethnic mix of Albanians, Bosniaks, Croats, Kosovars, Montenegrins, Serbs, Slovenians and others. After longtime ruler Josef Broz Tito’s death in 1980, ethnic tensions began to rise and Yugoslavia started to disintegrate. Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević sought to restore pre-1974 Serbian sovereign control. Multi-party elections in 1991 led to the secession wars of Croatia and Slovenia from the Yugoslav state in June 1991. This sparked the Bosnian independence movement, culminating in a 1992 referendum that established the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was mainly occupied by Bosniak Muslims with an Orthodox Serb minority. These Serbs opposed the secession and formed the Republika Srpska (RS), which was supported by Milošević’s Serbian forces. The subsequent years saw the Serbs lead a campaign of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia, particularly targeting Bosniak Muslims. Bosnian and Croat forces also took part in wartime atrocities. Near the end of the Bosnian War, the UN has established a demilitarized “safe area” in Srebrenica, policed by Dutch troops. On 6 July 1995, the RS Armed Forces under General Ratko Mladić began attacking Srebrenica. Within the course of the week, the city was massacred. Nearly 20,000 refugees, including demilitarized Bosnian soldiers, attempted to flee in the so-called “mixed column”, but were massacred on what has become known as the “road of death.” The remaining Srebrenica inhabitants sought shelter in with the UN forces at Potočari, but Dutch forces failed to stop Mladić’s forces from taking these inhabitants to be summarily executed. The Dayton Peace Accords were brokered by the U.S. in November 1995. Bosnia and Herzegovina was divided into the RS and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, each autonomous entities with independent power. In the years following, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was established and the events of the Bosnian War and other Yugoslavian Wars of secession became commonly understood as genocide. On 3 March 2003, the Human Rights Chamber of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Courts referred 49 applications from victims’ families that represented nearly 1,800 similar applications, all of which referred to Srebrenica, to the government, ordering it to fulfill its duty to investigate. In response, the RS Government created the Commission for Investigation of the Events in and around Srebrenica between 10th and 19th July 1995 on 15 December 2003 at the National Assembly’s 52th session. Its commissioners were appointed in December 2003 and included a representative of the International Commission of Missing Persons (Gordon Bacon) and the victims’ families (Smail Čekić). The ICTY and Office of the High Representative (OHR, who presided over post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina) were given observer status. However, the Commission initially received pushback from RS Official and government agencies. This enraged the OHR, who ordered several officials to be fired and replaced the Chair of the Commission with Milan Bogdanic. The Commission was initially only given 6 months to complete its work and submitted its final report in June 2004. The report was welcomed by the international community, particularly the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTY, prompting the Commission’s mandate to be extended until October 2004 in order to complete a full analysis of its evidentiary database. This database contained more than 150,000 names compiled from victims’ families, government and security forces lists, ICTY lists, and NGO lists. Of this 150,000, the Commission found that a significant number were duplicates. In total, the Commission investigated 13,298 missing persons. 4,556 fell outside of its temporal mandate. 936 had conflicting data for which there was at least one date on which they were reported missing that fell within the mandated period and one outside of it. The Commission thus could only confirm with certainty more than 7,800 deaths and/or disappearances between 10th and 19th July 1995. The final report stresses that this number will certainly increase as DNA evidence, blood samples, and exhumations continue. The database was essential to the Commission’s contribution to Srebrenica research generally because it compared existing victims’ lists, showing which victims appeared on every list, on, for example, both the ICTY and ICRC list, and which were unique to one list. The Commission had no judicial teeth; it could not take testimony or attribute criminal responsibility. However, it was empowered to investigate current and former state officials and support prosecutions. It made full use of this power by sharing its findings, evidence, and victims’ lists with ICTY, naming suspected perpetrators’ names in its final report, and encouraging the RS Government to carry out arrest warrants for suspected war criminals. Although the Commission did not have the power to exhume or identify body remains, it discovered and confirmed 32 previously unknown mass graves. It passed the information about these graves to the Federal Commission for Missing Persons, which was empowered to conduct exhumations. It also concluded that the events at Srebrenica were premediated and planned, and constituted grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. This was the first Bosnian Serb recognition of responsibility for the events at Srebrenica. In endorsing the final report, President Dragan Čavič acknowledged the events. The RS Government later issued a formal apology for the events at Srebrenica. In all of the former Yugoslavia, the Commission was the first official public truth project and overall went successfully. In the aftermath of its report, few Bosnian Serb politicians continued to deny the events at Srebrenica, and the Republika Srpska gradually became more cooperative with justice initiatives, transferring its first indictee to The Hague on January 16, 2005.",hybrid,domestic law,The RS National Assembly,,,2003,2003-12-15,,completed,0,2004,[https://web.archive.org/web/20181117062928/http://balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebr\_final\_e.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117062928/http:/balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebr_final_e.pdf),1,1,1,1,0,1,1,yes,yes,0,1,1,Yes,10th to 19th July 1995,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,13298,[https://web.archive.org/web/20190628072555/http://balkanwitness.glypx.com/bosnia-wireservice2004-11.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20190628072555/http:/balkanwitness.glypx.com/bosnia-wireservice2004-11.htm) [https://web.archive.org/web/20181117062928/http://balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebr\_final\_e.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20181117062928/http:/balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebr_final_e.pdf) [https://web.archive.org/web/20220420012006/http://balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebrenica\_report2004.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20220420012006/http:/balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebrenica_report2004.pdf)s,partially independent,Yes,7,Appointed by the RS Government,Yes,Unknown,,,[https://web.archive.org/web/20220420012006/http://balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebrenica\_report2004.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20220420012006/http:/balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebrenica_report2004.pdf) <https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/11357103/Commission_for_Investigation_of_the_Events_in_and_Around_Srebrenica_between_10_and_19_July_1995_%28Bosnia-Herzegovina%29.pdf>,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,[https://web.archive.org/web/20220420012006/http://balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebrenica\_report2004.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20220420012006/http:/balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebrenica_report2004.pdf),No,,No,No,No,No,,,,2004,Yes,"The government published the report in hard copy as Government of Republika Srpska.

158,590,0,Truth and Justice Commission,Truth and Justice Commission,"Mauritius has a long history of slavery and indentured servitude. It was colonized first by the Dutch, then the French, and finally by the British. Under British rule, slavery was formally abolished in 1835, but indentured servitude and slave-like conditions for ethnic Mauritians—the Creole—and Indian immigrants shipped in by the Dutch East India Company persisted in agricultural powerhouse industries such as sugar and pigs. Beyond a violation of freedom and wellbeing, slaves and indentured servants were systematically excluded from the benefits of the state. This systemic economic and social violence continued to impact their descendants even after independence and well into the 21st century. The legacies of slavery have resulted in health, education, social, legal, economic, and other forms of discrimination. The Truth and Justice Commission in Mauritius was created in August 2008 by the National Assembly’s TJC Act to investigate the abuses and legacies of slavery and indentured servitude that occurred during the colonial and post-colonial period since 1638. As such, it is neither a post-conflict nor a post-authoritarian TC. This 370-year mandate is evidently unique, as is the content of the TJC—it dealt with violations of ESCR rather than CPR and proposed 300 recommendations toward socioeconomic, class or caste, and cultural reform. The TJC enjoyed considerable power; it could compel testimony and the production of documents, and while it could not penalize non-compliance itself, it could request the assistance of the police and Judge in Chambers in order to force compliance with its summons and subpoenas. Notably, the Judge in Chambers had the opportunity to weigh the necessity of the document or testimony requested by the TJC and any “prejudice likely to arise from its disclosure” before issuing an order for the production of the testifier or document. In this way, the courts could also deny or withhold summon or subpoena enforcement from the TJC. The TJC had 5 commissioners, one of whom was a South African and the former deputy chair of the South African TRC. Its hearings were public except when the TJC deemed that a witness needed protection. According to its Final Report, delivered to the government in November 2011, it conducted 212 hearings, most of which were public or semi-public. It also investigated 230 cases of land dispossession. The in camera recordings of these hearings, as well as many of the TJC’s acquired ethnographic research, artifacts, and historical documents are available in a public Digital Archive. The Final Report also ascribes responsibility to former colonial powers and the state, recommending reparations, memorialization, educational reform, policies aimed at reducing racial discrimination and classism, poverty reduction, land redistribution and even collectivization, and an improved public memory and understanding of Mauritian history. However, none of its recommendations have been implemented. While the National Assembly established several committees to implement the recommendations, these have largely been for show or rhetoric.",hybrid,domestic law,The National Assembly,,,2008,2008-08-28,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/ROL/Truth%20and%20Justice%20Act%2028%20No_%202008-2.pdf>,completed,0,2009,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/ROL/Truth%20and%20Justice%20Act%2028%20No_%202008-2.pdf>,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"1638 to the present, 2008",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,500000,<https://www.usip.org/publications/2012/02/truth-commission-mauritius>,fully independent,Yes,5,"According to the TJC Act, the “members… shall be appointed by the President on such terms and conditions as the President may determine.

Unlike in the previous uprising, the JVP relied heavily on the use of assassinations of important religious and political figures, subversion, and terror attacks. The government responded just as brutally; the government has been accused of using detention camps in several locations, including Batalanda, to quell the JVP uprising. The camps were said to be run by anti-subversive units of the police who were tasked with destroying rebels. It is believed that nearly 5,000 to 10,000 JVP activists were brutally tortured and killed in the Batalanda camp alone. Incumbent President and current leader of the UNP Ranil Wickremesinghe has been accused of being the political authority behind the alleged detention centre. The Batalanda commission was appointed by the government of Chandrika Kumaratunga to look into the violations of human rights and crimes committed in the Batalanda torture and detention centre. In its report, the commission recommended the government to take legal action against then-opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and to strip him of his civic rights, which would have made him ineligible to run for elections. No legal action has been taken against Wickremesinghe by any government to date, however, and many who were arrested for their involvement in the alleged killings have been revealed to be from organizations such as the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party, a political party founded in 1984 by Kumaratunga and her husband, Vijaya Kumaratunga, who was assassinated by the JVP in 1988",domestic,domestic law,President Chandrika Kumaratunga,,<https://sangam.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Batalanda-Commission-Report-Book-English-Final.pdf>,1995,1995-12-15,,completed,0,1995,<https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ok7lzkndde71oq9xrnhnv/Commissions-of-Inquiry-Sri-Lanka.xlsx?cloud_editor=excel&dl=0&rlkey=115pm4dgwyzojyqg84ziv2zcb>,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,,,0,1,1,Yes,1987-1990,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,,<https://sangam.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Batalanda-Commission-Report-Book-English-Final.pdf>,don't know,Yes,3,Chosen by the President,,,,,,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,,,,,,Yes,Unknown,,,,2000,Yes,The government,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,1,,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,,<https://www.dailynews.lk/2021/03/01/features/242755/commissions-and-truth>,Unknown,,https://www.dailynews.lk/2021/03/01/features/242755/commissions-and-truth https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6acfd54.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batalanda_detention_centre Post-War Justice in Sri Lanka by Kishali-Pinto Jayawardena,1,,conducted outreach,,,,,executive,addressing corruption; prevention of human rights violations; responsibility; recognition of victims; coexistence; non-recurrence,pass constitutional amendments,,state government,,,,,,2024-01-25

In particular, the US struck a $322,000 deal with Noriega in return for intelligence on the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and help trafficking arms to the US-sponsored contra rebels. Noriega became increasingly problematic, however. In addition to blatant corruption, Noriega trafficked arms and drugs, prompting many US Congress members and White House executives to question how the US could both support Noriega and maintain its “war on drugs”. In 1985, several high-profile murders of opposition members occurred, and it was revealed that Noriega was selling US intelligence to Cuba’s Fidel Castro, prompting the US to stop economic assistance in 1987. In 1989, Noriega orchestrated elections, but the very obvious fraud and manipulation prompted rioting, violence, and the church’s involvement in denouncing Noriega. This instability, including the killing of a US Marine, precipitated US invasion “Operation Just Cause” on December 20, 1989. Noriega surrendered to the US in January 1990 and was convicted by a Miami court for his trafficking crimes. The US did not pull out of Panama until September 1994. In 2000, exhumations at a former military base revealed four human skeletons, including one mistakenly thought to belong to Jose Hector Gallego, a Colombian priest abducted by the military in 1971, prompting President to establish la Comisión de la Verdad Panamá (Panama Truth Commission) to investigate human rights violations (namely, death and disappearance). However, the TC’s mandate ended on 1989; during its design process, stakeholders and commissioner candidates emphasized that investigating US invasion would just be too much for its year-long mandate. The TC was successful, conducting 36 exhumations, DNA testing on the discovered remains, and identifying 110 cases of violations. One of its explicit recommendations was the declaration of a federal holiday of commemoration on December 20, 1989, the day of US invasion. But in the years after the TC, this recommendation became a highly politicized topic and political and social will for a US-invasion-specific commission grew. On July 19, 2016, President Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez met this demand through Executive Decree No. 121, which created la Comisión 20 de diciembre 1989 (December 20, 1989 Commission). The Decree explicitly states that the Commission will investigate violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during the invasion, encompassing a wide variety of crimes, but, like the TC before it, the December 20 Commission focuses on death and disappearance. In this way, it is a conflict TC specialized to inter- rather than intra-state conflict. Also like the previous TC, the December 20 Commission’s mandate emphasizes its lack of judicial power; it cannot attribute responsibility for the crimes it investigates. It is made up of 5 commissioners, headed by Juan Planells. It was granted only 2 years to complete its mandate, but this has been extended 4 times; currently, the Commission plans to submit its final report in July 2023. This is for a multiplicity of reasons; the original concerns with the sheer quantity of information about the invasion were valid, and the Commission has also continuously suffered from a lack of funding. Some critics claim that the US-sympathetic legislature wants to truncate or stall investigations. The Commission has presented (approximately) 5 interim reports at public Q&A sessions, but none of these reports are available with the other public archival information in on its website, http://comision20dediciembrede1989.org.pa/. In its early days, the Commission functioned as a war inquiry commission more than anything else. It revealed US PSYOP operations, including propaganda, political cartoons, and other media designed to manipulate the Panamanian public into accepting that the war was a ‘just cause.’ The release of the Panama Files revealed hundreds of classified documents about the invasion, including transcripts of Bush’s calls to Latin American heads of state before invading and death records of 202 civilians and 314 soldiers. The Commission also established the Uniform Registry of Victims, to which families could submit information about their missing or killed family. A preliminary list of 341 victims is published on their website, but Commission President Planells has publicly spoken about 350 victims while simultaneously maintaining that only 250 of these names have been confirmed. The Commission also embarked upon a lobbying crusade in the legislature to demand the establishment of a Day of Mourning on December 20. This was not formally created until 2020 legislation. The second half of the Commission’s extended mandate has been focused on exhumations. After receiving its initial $900,000 budget, the Commission partnered with the community development and memorialization project Fundación Ciudad del Saber (City of Knowledge), which orchestrated logistics and financial planning. It began anthropological work in el Jardín de Paz in 2017, finding 33 body bags on which it conducted DNA testing. After, it found another 8 body bags in the Monte de Esperanza Colón cemetery. The Public Prosecutor agreed to cooperate with the Commission, reopening 15 cases based on the forensic evidence discovered from exhumation and opening judicial archives to the commissioners. The University of Panama is also in cooperation with the Commission, which installed a Working Group on International Law from the Postgraduate Studies of the University to guide the legal investigations. The Commission also collaborated with the Museum of Contemporary Art to hold ‘An Invasion in 4 Times’ art exhibition for victims and families. In 2020, the Commission began reporting that it had used up its budget, asking for an additional $465,000 to finish exhumations. It received an advance of $180,000 in 2020 and the remaining funds in 2021. Hopefully, it will finally complete its work in 2023.",domestic,domestic law,President Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez,,,2016,2016-07-19,<https://comision20dediciembrede1989.org.pa/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GacetaNo_28078a_20160720.pdf>,ongoing,0,2016,<https://comision20dediciembrede1989.org.pa/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GacetaNo_28078a_20160720.pdf>,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"December 19, 1989 until the end of US invasion (September 1994)",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,350,<https://comision20dediciembrede1989.org.pa/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GacetaNo_28078a_20160720.pdf> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bkKCvgV1IU> <https://www.laestrella.com.pa/nacional/201021/comision-busca-victimas-invasion-20-diciembre-1989-logra-mas-fondos>,fully independent,Yes,5,"Named in the Executive Decree, i.e. appointed by the President.",No,Yes,,1381661,<https://comision20dediciembrede1989.org.pa/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GacetaNo_28078a_20160720.pdf> <https://www.critica.com.pa/nacional/casi-1-millon-para-investigar-la-invasion-457378> <https://www.laestrella.com.pa/nacional/210407/aprueban-traslado-partida-285-mil-comision-20-diciembre> <https://www.tvn-2.com/contenido-exclusivo/gobierno-dolares-trabajos-comision-diciembre_1_1132486.html>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://comision20dediciembrede1989.org.pa/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GacetaNo_28078a_20160720.pdf>,Yes,,No,Yes,Yes,No,,,https://comision20dediciembrede1989.org.pa/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GacetaNo_28078a_20160720.pdf https://twitter.com/comision20dedic/status/1385734995772325889,,No,,,,,,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,No,,"“Culmina Exhumación de Víctimas de La Invasión En Colón, Hallaron 8 Bolsas Con Restos Óseos -,” October 23, 2021. https://comision20dediciembrede1989.org.pa/index.php/2021/10/23/culmina-exhumacion-de-victimas-de-la-invasion-en-colon-hallaron-8-bolsas-con-restos-oseos/.

197,2,0,The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians,The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians,"Upon the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United States forcibly relocated about 120,000 Japanese Americans and people of Japanese ancestry, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast in internment camps. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order No. 9066 of February 19, 1942 initiated these abusive actions by the justification that people of Japanese descent may conduct espionage or sabotage on the US efforts in WWII. The government thus tried to contain and monitor this “national security threat”. Conditions in the internment camps were severely lacking, with tar paper covered barracks, sometimes without running water, sanitary facilities, or gas. Food, education, and health services did not meet international standards. In a related policy, upon the invasion of the Alaskan Aleutian Islands by the Japanese, US troops evacuated all the Aleutians and interned them in similar concentration camps in Alaska, where they endured often much worse conditions, being placed in old gold mines and canneries and subjected to the bleaker Alaskan elements. While the evacuation was for Aleutians safety as Japanese and US troops warred in their villages, it was still a grave violation of their human rights as they were displaced without food, adequate shelter, health and sanitation services, and were held against their will. When Aleutians finally returned to their villages, they discovered that many of their homes had been burned, damaged, or destroyed, along with all their personal possessions, violating their right to privacy, family life, and a home. In the 1960s, internment became a divisive issue among Japanese American civil society, and at its 1970 convention, the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) began a call for reparations to help them recover lost education, income, and opportunity. Senator Daniel Inouye first proposed a commission to the JACL and other Japanese members of Congress in 1979. Despite some pockets of dissent, the JACL overall realized that a commission would be an important political and educational tool and began to lobby for its establishment. In 1980, Congress overwhelmingly passed Public Law 96-317, which created the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians to formally investigate Executive Order No. 9066 and propose remedies for the interned Japanese and Aleutians. The Commission, which began work in 1981, was initially only given one year to complete its work but was later extended to two years and allocated $1,500,000. It was chaired by Washington lawyer Joan Bernstein and its commissioners included judges, former Supreme Court justices, civil rights activists, and William Marutani, a Japanese-American who had been relocated with his family to the internment camps in 1942. The Commission had powers to compel testimony and documentation from individuals and public agencies and could ask the Attorney General to enforce these powers. Over the course of its investigation, it conducted public hearings across the nation, mostly on the West Coast, took 750 testimonies and received hundreds of documents. The final report, published in 1983, concluded that the internment policy was “deplorable” and mainly driven by “race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership.” The Commission report also cited enormous material and intangible losses, including lost education and job training, loss of family structure, and prolonged racial stigma. It also proposes 11 recommendations, which are almost all relating to individual or collective reparations. It recommends a per capita payment of $20,000 to each of the approximately 60,000 Japanese survivors, a fund to sponsor research and public educational activities about internment to promote remembrance, and a $5 million fund for Aleutian communities and individuals in addition to $5,000 per capita to the few hundred surviving Aleuts. Although reparations faced considerable resistance in Congress, the Commission played an enormous role in the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which granted internment survivors a public apology, individual reparations of $20,000 each, and a public education fund. The Commission also served to educate the public—many American citizens had at first resisted the internment of their Japanese neighbors but had acquiesced after Pearl Harbor, fearful of fifth column activity. The Commission helped the general American public see their own complicity in the violation of citizens’ human rights through interviews with the media, allowing media coverage of hearings, and making Personal Justice Denied accessible to the public. It also provided the political will for the coram nobis cases of Fred Korematsu, Min Yasui, and Gordon Hirabayashi, which resulted in wartime convictions being overturned.",domestic,domestic law,Congress,,,1980,1980-07-31,<https://www.congress.gov/96/statute/STATUTE-94/STATUTE-94-Pg964.pdf>,completed,0,1981,<https://www.congress.gov/96/statute/STATUTE-94/STATUTE-94-Pg964.pdf>,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,December 1941 and 1945,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,121000,<https://www.congress.gov/96/statute/STATUTE-94/STATUTE-94-Pg964.pdf>,fully independent,Yes,9,"According to Public Law 96-317, two members were appointed by the President, two members were appointed by the Speaker of the House, and two members were appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate.

127,155,0,"National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture, also the Valech Commission","Comisión Nacional Sobre Prisón Politica y Tortura, o sea la ""Valech Commission"" (National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture, also the Valech Commission)","General Augusto Pinochet led a military coup against President Salvador Allende in September 1973 that marked the beginning of a nearly 30-year authoritarian military junta. The period of Pinochet’s rule from 1973-1990 was marked by politically-motivated human rights violations, including illegal imprisonment, disappearances, assassinations, torture including sexual violence, and kidnappings. During this period of time, the military enjoyed full impunity due to their association with Pinochet and maintained that they were fighting an “internal war” to justify their widespread abuses of power. When Patricio Aylwin was elected in 1989, Pinochet and the military still enjoyed impunity due to Pinochet’s 1980 Constitution specifically designed to protect himself and his accessories and rig the Chilean system with military seats in the judicial and legislative branches. To facilitate truth for victims, reconciliation, and symbolic reparation, President Aylwin created la Comisión Nacional de Verdad y Reconciliación, which was also called the ‘Rettig Commission’ after its President, Raúl Rettig. This TRC was an important step and made several important contributions to historical narrative, including directly blaming the military and synthesizing names and cases from other organizations, but it was limited in power and mandate. Importantly, it did not include any of the political violence or human rights violations that did not result in death. This left a large gap in its investigations. President Ricardo Lagos created la Comisión Nacional Sobre Prisón Politica y Tortura, the Valech Commission, to pick up where the Rettig Commission left off and further document the abuses under Pinochet’s military dictatorship. Supreme Decree No. 1040 of September 26, 2003 created the Valech Commission. It was, first and foremost, an advisory body which improved upon the Rettig Commission’s investigation through an expanded mandate and was empowered to advise the President on the best ways in which victims reparations could be made to those that were excluded by the Rettig Commission. Hence, its mandated time period was the same, September 11, 1971 to March 10, 1990, but it covered all of the violations of civil rights and politically motivated violence, not only those that resulted in death. Its powers were largely similar, however, with no power to compel testimony or subpoena documents and an emphasized, reiterated separation from the judicial branch, which retained exclusive control of attributing legal liability on any perpetrators. Of the 35,865 cases that the Valech Commission initially was presented, it was only able to make a definitive “moral conviction” that 27,255 of those cases had been victims. For this reason, President Ricardo Lagos issued Supreme Decree No. 1086 of November 3, 2004, which expanded the Commission’s mandate to address the approximately 8,000 additional, unresolved cases in a complimentary report. The complimentary report identified an additional 1,204 cases, bringing the number of total victims up to 28,459. The Valech commission also concluded that torture and detention were used as tools for political control by State authorities and perpetuated by decrees and laws that protected repressive behavior, implicitly supported by the judiciary. Torture by members of the Armed Forces and Carabineros (paramilitary police) was a generalized practice on a national scale. The highest rate of detainment and number of detainees tortured occurred in 1973. The Valech Commission had a much more pronounced public impact than the Rettig Commission. Many of its recommendations were actually taken, including its demand that both the President and the military publicly acknowledge and apologize for the human rights abuses. That the military accepted responsibility is incredible considering its previous response to the Rettig Commission, which vehemently rejected any blame. Furthermore, President Lagos granted all 28,459 victims with lifelong compensation, healthcare, housing, and free education. Even 4 years after the complementary report, President Michelle Bachelet created the National Institute for Human Rights recommended by the Valech Report. She also “readapted” the Commission, again headed by Monsignor Sergio Valech, as la Comisión Asesora para la calificación de Detenidos Desaparecidos, Ejecutados Políticos y Víctimas de Prisión Política y Tortura (Commission for the Qualification of Disappeared Detainees, Political Executions, and Victims of Political Imprisonment and Torture).

162,790,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,सत्य निरुपण तथा मेलमिलाप आयोग (Truth and Reconciliation Commission),"The Nepalese Civil War began in 1996, when the Communist Party of Nepal launched an insurgency against the royal government with the explicit purpose of overthrowing the monarchy. During the civil war, more than 13,000 people died and 150,000 people fled conflict. Both sides perpetrated numerous violations of human rights during this time, including repression of journalists, suspension of civil and political rights, summary executions, forced disappearances, massacres, purges, and mass rapes. The civil war ended in 2006 with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, in which clause 5.2.5 stipulates the establishment of a TRC to ensure peaceful transition and coexistence. In the years after the Agreement (and until today), the government was led by coalition of former Maoist rebels and the Marxist-Leninist Party, including many known perpetrators. This government made at least three aborted attempts at a TRC, in 2008, 2009, and 2013, each struck down by victims’ groups and civil society activism and/or litigation. The 2013 attempt resulted in a writ before the Supreme Court, in which the Court ruled that amnesties for crimes of international criminal law and gross violations of human rights are impermissible and enforced reconciliation is incompatible with the spirit of genuine reconciliation. Although victims’ groups and civil society were involved in the new drafting process following the 2013 Supreme Court ruling, three major parties quietly issued whips to force parliamentarians to withdraw other bills and vote instead for their bill, which ignored the directives from the Supreme Court. The final text of the bill was not released publicly or shared with victims’ groups or civil society, but signed into law as the Enforced Disappearances Inquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act on April 21, 2014. It established two commissions, one Commission of Inquiry for Enforced Disappearances and one TRC. The TRC would be composed of 5 commissioners and was granted the powers to summon, subpoena, search and seize, hold individuals in contempt and issue fines for failure to obey. Despite broad powers, the TRC had a vague mandate with a narrow range of investigation not including violations of international criminal law or the root causes of conflict. It was also barred from investigating any matter already decided or being decided in front of a court, including pending writs of habeas corpus for the arbitrarily detained or forcibly disappeared. Also, the mechanism of reconciliation was actively in conflict with the former Supreme Court ruling; reconciliation was only available for perps who had not been recommended for amnesty, i.e. only those who were still available to be prosecuted. Victims that petitioned the TRC for reconciliation would enter into a process of arbitration wherein the TRC would “cause the perpetrator to regret the wrongful act” and perhaps order compensation to the victim. Then, once reconciliation has magically occurred, the perpetrator is no longer eligible for legal action. This clearly put victims in danger, both of revictimization during the confrontation with the perp, as well as of being coerced by the perp into filing a petition with the TRC for reconciliation in order to “clear” the perps name from future prosecution. This bill was immediately condemned by international and national observers, including the UN and Amnesty International, who again took the issue to the Supreme Court, which struck down several of the provisions, namely the enforced reconciliation, the possibility of amnesties for crimes under international law and gross human rights violations, and the lack of adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality. The Government of Nepal filed a petition with the Supreme Court to review its decision, but this petition was rejected on April 27,2020. The TRC Act has yet to be amended, and during this time, the TRC has functioned as if it was constitutional, with its originally 2-year mandate extended on February 9, 2017, February 6, 2018, and February 8, 2019 (as has the mandate of the COI). In January 2020, the government extended again and appointed new commissioners. “According to sources, it is alleged that the appointments were politically influenced, and that they disregarded the victims’ sentiments, the opinions of the national stakeholders, and the concerns expressed by the international community,” claims a report from the OHCHR. Victims and civil society that have interacted with the TRC have routinely complained about its inability to deliver. Out of 63,718 complaints registered by victims, only 4,000—less than 10%— have been investigated. As of 2021, the TRC recommended material reparations of Rs 2.32 million ($1,837,019) to 29 victims, and symbolic-economic reparations to 29 other victims, including interest-free loans, skill development training, and scholarship for education. The government of Nepal, which has to approve all reparations, is yet to approve this, however. Some community initiatives have been taken by local governments, including memorialization parks and services for victims. The most recent reports suggest that the government is now attempting to establish a transitional justice mechanism to be led by the Minister of Law and Justice. Some civil society praise this, hoping that another commission could result in success, but others consider this just more of the same. In general, academics and on-the-ground activists alike agree that the TRC has completely lost credibility and is perceived as the result of a political agenda to protect impunity while appeasing international demands.",domestic,domestic law,Parliament,,,2014,2014-04-25,,ongoing,0,2015,,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"February 13, 1996 to November 21, 2006",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,,"<https://trc.gov.np/#:~:text=5%20of%20Comprehensive%20Peace%20Accord,and%20to%20create%20enabling%20environment>",not independent,Yes,5,"The TRC Act states that a recommendation committee will appoint the commissioners in a public selection process.

163,93,0,"Truth, Justice and Peace Commission","Comisión de la Verdad, Justicia, y Paz (Truth, Justice and Peace Commission)","The Nicaraguan Revolution (1960-90) against the Somoza dictatorship saw the rise of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), a Marxist revolutionary guerilla group that gained notoriety and ultimately legitimacy as a formal political party. After the fall of the Somoza dictatorship in 1979, guerilla Daniel Ortega led the provisional government the Junta of National Reconstruction until the organization of elections in 1984, when Ortega was reelected. Ortega was defeated in the 1990, 1996, and 2001 elections, but returned to the presidency in 2006, at which point the FSLN also controlled the National Assembly, which was presided over by the former guerilla leader of the original, revolutionary and pre-party FSLN, Gustavo Porras. Ortega took a number of anti-democratic measures, including extending the terms of some elected or appointed officials by decree and taking control of the Supreme Court, which disqualified a number of opposition parties and nullified the presidential term limits contained in the constitution Ortega had previously helped create. Ortega “won” again in the unfree and unfair 2011 and 2016 elections, with each term offering new evidence of his authoritarianism: Ortega’s family and other FSLN allies bought all of the media companies and did not allow “anti-FSLN” sentiment in the news, the regime suppressed opposition by ousting leaders from the National Assembly, and the police, pro-government paramilitaries, and state-sponsored Sandinista Youth were militarized. In April 2018, a fire in the Indo-Maíz indigenous reserve was neglected by Ortega, who rejected help from neighboring Costa Rica and failed to devote enough resources to the fire, prompting indigenous and student protests. At the same time, the FSLN-controlled National Assembly passed social security reform that neglected the working class and poor—the same interest groups who were already protesting or supportive of the protests. The protests grew in size and violence, with protestors being killed by police, pro-government paramilitaries, and Sandinista youth. On Mother’s Day, 300,000 people marched to commemorate the lives already lost and protest government repression but were fired on point-blank in what is now known as the “Mother’s Day Massacre.” Opposition were allegedly “hunted” and an estimated 1,400 people were killed or injured, resulting in sanctions against Ortega’s government, which continues to rule to this day and has only further cracked down on dissent. On April 29, 2018, the National Assembly issued Joint Resolution 03-2018, which created la Comisión de la Verdad, Justicia, y Paz (Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission). The mandate was exceedingly barren—only 3 clauses, it omits any clarification of the scope of the CVJP’s investigations, the crimes the CVJP will investigate, its organizational structure, and the CVJP’s powers. According to the mandate, the CVJP only has 3 months to present its work, but it has received extensions biannually and is ongoing to this day. The CVJP is widely considered a puppet institution to advance Ortega and the FSLN’s political agenda and has been called the “lie commission” and “Porras commission” by civil society and non-state-sponsored media outlets. Each of its 5 commissioners is an FSLN member and has been known to publicly defend Ortega’s violence. The IACHR and OHCHR have rejected the CVJP, refusing to work with it unless they can conduct their own independent investigations with the full collaboration of Ortega’s government first. In a report, the IACHR made clear that they hold Ortega’s government responsible for “murders, extrajudicial executions, ill-treatment, possible acts of torture and arbitrary detentions committed against the mostly young population.” The CVJP has issued four reports so far, all allegedly available for public consumption on their website, at https://www.cvjp.org.ni/, but this link displays an error message that makes these reports apparently inaccessible for the purpose of this research. The first report, published in July 2018, acknowledged 222 deaths during the time period, 13 of which were not linked to the protests. Each successive report has changed this number, first to 282, then reduced to 269 and again to 253. This is in contrast with the estimates from NGOs and international bodies; the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights records 448 dead, the Nicaraguan Center for Human rights records 306, and the IACHR records 355. Other information contained in the report includes a large section on the roadblocks imposed by protestors to destabilize commerce and draw the attention of Ortega. The second report claims that the roadblocks themselves “produced human rights violations,” blaming opposition groups and protestors for creating nuclei of violence that, in addition, created significant economic losses. This report also assesses the damages to the state and private companies caused by protestor vandalism. The commissioners called on these opposition groups to contribute to the establishment of a climate of justice, peace and social stability, wholly ignoring the violations committed by police, special forces, and pro-government paramilitary. While the CVJP has interviewed state officials, including the retired general commissioner of the National Police, it has failed to take any testimony from witnesses present at the scenes of violation or from any victims personally. This unwillingness to hear from victims and their families in addition to the demonstrated effort to circumvent the most pressing topic—violence against protestors—in favor of comparatively trivial topics such as roadblocks and vandalism only serve as evidence that the CVJP is indeed advancing a political agenda.",domestic,domestic law,National Assembly president and former Sandinista guerilla Gustavo Porras,,,2018,2018-04-29,<http://legislacion.asamblea.gob.ni/Normaweb.nsf/164aa15ba012e567062568a2005b564b/0dec5e914b77941e062582720071dc4e?OpenDocument>,ongoing,1,2018,,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"April 18- July 4, 2018",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,622,"<https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:91569-comision-de-la-verdad-la-justicia-y-la-paz-presentara-cuarto-informe> <https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20190206/46268152127/comision-de-la-verdad-reduce-de-269-a-253-los-muertos-en-nicaragua-por-crisis.html> <https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comisi%C3%B3n_de_la_Verdad,_Justicia_y_Paz_(Nicaragua)>",not independent,Yes,5,"The mandate specifies that the “commission will be made up of notable Nicaraguans from different sectors: jurists, intellectuals, religious, youth, civil society organizations, and personalities that are in agreement with dialogue and peace.” According to HRW, a board of 7 lawmakers (5 of whom belong to Ortega’s party) opaquely picked the 5 commissioners",No,No,,,"<https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/14/nicaraguas-truth-commission-farce> <https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comisi%C3%B3n_de_la_Verdad,_Justicia_y_Paz_(Nicaragua)> <https://www.articulo66.com/2018/04/28/asamblea-nacional-anuncia-conformacion-comision-la-verdad/>",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Unknown,,No,No,No,Unknown,,,,,No,,,,,,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,No,,"Artículo 66. “Asamblea Nacional Anuncia Conformación de ‘Comisión de La Verdad,’” April 28, 2018. https://www.articulo66.com/2018/04/28/asamblea-nacional-anuncia-conformacion-comision-la-verdad/.

140,255,0,Commission of Inquiry for Working Through the History and the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in Germany,(Commission of Inquiry for Working Through the History and the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in Germany) Die Enquete-Kommission Aufarbeitung von Geschichte und Folgen der SED-Diktatur in Deutschland,"After World War II, Germany was divided into four military zones. The three Western zones governed by the Allies were known as the Federal Republic of Germany while the Eastern zone became the German Democratic Republic. The GDR was ruled by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), which restricted political, economic, and personal freedoms to consolidate social control and enforce their Marxist-Leninist ideological project. The SED purged even relatively leftist parties from political life, including the social democrats and liberals, becoming one of the most hard-line parties in the Soviet bloc. Faced with growing civil unrest in 1989, SED leader Erich Honecker was forced to resign and East German citizens were allowed to enter West Germany. In 1990, Germany was reunited after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The united German transition government created an incredibly complex political system. Germans overwhelmingly demanded an answer to persisting questions about the SED dictatorship and a recognition of the violations inflicted by the SED dictatorship. In 1992, the German Parliament, the Bundestag, responded to these demands by passing Act No. 12/2597, which created Die Enquete-Kommission Aufarbeitung von Geschichte und Folgen der SED-Diktatur in Deutschland (Commission of Inquiry for Working Through the History and the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in Germany). This was a parliamentary committee comprised of 16 parliamentarian members of the Bundestag elected by their parties and eleven external experts nominated by parties and formally selected and appointed by the President of the Bundestag. It had a narrow, fact-finding mandate 1945-1989 that included an element of reconciliation and “rehabilitation” for victims. It had slim powers, including no power of subpoena or summons. It was different from other, more traditional TCs simply because the repression under the SED was different from many dictatorships. Aside from crimes nature against political opposition, including using criminal justice as a weapon through prison conditions, mistreatment, restrictions of liberty, etc., the SED’s violations were largely psychosocial. Hayner notes that while the SED certainly used physical repression against dissidents, many suffered less violent consequences: they were barred from universities, prohibited from working in their chosen profession, or continuously harassed by authorities, for example. The COI thus reached beyond a focus on gross human rights violations to a broader inquiry into government policy and practice. All of its proceedings, including all testimony, were held at public hearings, the content of which is entirely recorded word-for-word in its 18-volume report. The length and density of the final report was heavily criticized because it was geared more toward an academic and research audience rather than the general public, who were the ones campaigning for the COI in the first place. However, the report is well-detailed and all-encompassing, offering complex testimony and investigations. It concludes that the SED became progressively more repressive, with a pervasive monopoly of power that effectively predetermined the composition of legislative bodies in East Germany. The report is available on the COI’s website, which was published after the establishment of a second COI in 1995. This follow-up institution was recommended by this 1992 COI in order to further its work and the presence of the topic in the collective “democratic consciousness”.

196,200,0,The Bloody Sunday Inquiry,The Bloody Sunday Inquiry,"The Troubles was a period of guerilla conflict and terrorism between Northern Ireland, represented by the Irish Republican Army, and Great Britain. The grievances that caused this violence can be traced back centuries, largely to the Protestant-Catholic division in Ireland. While Protestants largely identify as British and unionist, Catholics identify as Irish and nationalist. In 1921, Ireland was partitioned, forming the self-governing Northern Ireland, which was majority Protestant. The Irish Catholics there suffered from economic and social disadvantage, tensions that continued for decades before spilling over in 1969 rioting in Derry. The growth of Paramilitaries—not only the IRA, but a split off Provisional IRA, and reactionary loyalist Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Bombings and grenades in public locations became regular, prompting the British Army to occupy Northern Ireland to “maintain peace”. On 31 January 1972, 15,000 protested British troops’ presence and the policy of detention without trial that the British had installed in Northern Ireland. The march was banned by the British, who deployed paratroopers to arrest those that participated. Tear gas and rubber bullets dispersed some protestors, but the march continued. Moving out of their barricade, the paratroopers opened fire on the unarmed Northern Irish, killing 14 and injuring 77. This only escalated the conflict, prompting a period of intense terrorism; in response to Bloody Sunday, the IRAP killed 9 in Belfast in a series of bombings on what became known as Bloody Friday. The Troubles formally ended with the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998, which created a power-sharing mechanism, but over 30 years, it is estimated that 3,500 were killed. Immediately after the events of Bloody Sunday, the Home Secretary announced that a public inquiry would be conducted by the Lord Chief Justice Widgery, whose findings were published in April 1972. The content and conclusions of his report were largely rejected by the families of victims, who continually campaigned for a new inquiry. In the 1990s, new evidence came to light, academics reiterated that Widgery’s inquiry was biased and inaccurate, and the Irish Government called for a new investigation. PM Tony Blair announced on 29 January 1998 a Tribunal of Inquiry according to the previously enacted Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921. The resolution for the Inquiry was formally passed in the House of Lords on 2 February 1998. The Inquiry had the powers to compel documents and testimony and could hold any recalcitrant or obstructive person in criminal contempt. It was composed of 4 commissioners, legal authorities led by Lord Saville. While the Inquiry did not include victims’ representatives, it did grant interested party status to victims and the families of deceased victims—meaning that they were present whenever relevant evidence was being discussed, and they were entitled to legal representation and to cross-examine witnesses. Limited interested party status, wherein one was only entitled to legal representation and witness cross-examination but was not privileged enough to sit in on Inquiry discussions, was granted to former IRA members, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), and other institutional stakeholders. Over the course of six years, the Inquiry heard 922 oral testimonies and received 1,562 written testimonies, mostly at its subnational office in Derry. Nearly all of its testimony was broadcast live on CCTV, and all of its testimony was transcribed. The transcriptions of public hearings were publicly available on the Inquiry’s website, at https://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org.uk/qa.html. The Inquiry had extensive witness protections but announced its intention to publish the names of the Support Company members who fired the first shots. The Court of Appeal in London barred the Inquiry from doing so by ruling that the soldiers directly involved in the shooting should remain anonymous to prevent a life of fear and public humiliation. The Inquiry, and Lord Saville, was faulted for accepting this ruling at face value rather than initiating an appeal in a higher court. Lord Saville was, in general, criticized harshly. One of the solicitors named as a staff member in the report stated “If the English courts are going to interfere in the inquiry then the international dimension to it is rendered worthless… [it raises] the whole question of Lord Saville's credibility and independence.” As a commercial judge that had no experience in peacebuilding, truth commissions, or even public inquiries, it is generally accepted that he treated the Inquiry as an excessively legal affair that prioritized superior legal authority over truth-seeking—and thus prioritized adversarial apportionment of blame over learning lessons. Academics that study the Inquiry claim that it is a perfect example of the importance of demarcation between those who are fit to hold judicial office and those who are fit to chair a truth commission. The Inquiry was also criticized for being too long and using too much money, prompting Parliament to pass a new Inquiries Act in 2005 that set up future Inquiries to be much less independent under the watchful eye of Parliamentary oversight. Pursuant to the Court of Appeal’s ruling, the final report does not name many names, although the Inquiry unearthed substantial information about direct responsibility. The names it does offer are already known to the public, such as the higher commanding officers. Its final report, published in 2010 and accessible to the public via the Inquiry’s website and other government websites, does provide significant insight into the overall Troubles, explaining the causes of violence in addition to the step-by-step events of Bloody Sunday. To the satisfaction of the NICRA and other Northern Irish interest groups, it repeatedly uses the word “unjustifiable” to describe the violence, finding that not one of the killed Irishmen were carrying a gun, the soldiers were in no danger, and they intentionally tried to misdirect Widgery’s inquiry, possible perjuring themselves. It does not make recommendations. While the Inquiry does not make any explosive findings, it was nonetheless very important. The Inquiry helped pave the way for the Good Friday Agreement by signaling that the British were willing to accept responsibility and hold their own accountable. PM David Cameron formally apologized to the North Irish in a public address in Derry to over 10,000 people. As of 2019, one of the soldiers who killed 2 Irishmen and attempted to kill 4 others, known as Soldier F, was prosecuted. The charges against him were dropped in 2021, but as of March 2022, the High Court in Belfast quashed that decision, ruling that his prosecution must continue.",hybrid,domestic law,Parliament under Tony Blair,,,1998,1998-02-02,<https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/11-12/7/introduction/enacted>,completed,0,1998,<https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ruling-on-bloody-sunday-soldiers-anonymity-reserved-1.204069> <https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-bloody-sunday-inquiry>,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,The period immediately preceding and the events of 30th January 1972,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,102,<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-bloody-sunday-inquiry> <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/11-12/7/introduction/enacted>,fully independent,Yes,3,Appointed by Parliament.,No,Yes,21,400000000,<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-bloody-sunday-inquiry> <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/11-12/7/introduction/enacted> <https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/12/bloody-sunday-inquiry-editorial> <https://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/4784> <https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2017/09/07/book-review-public-inquiries-wrong-route-on-bloody-sunday-by-louis-blom-cooper/>,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,<https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/11-12/7/introduction/enacted>,Yes,2484,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-bloody-sunday-inquiry https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/11-12/7/introduction/enacted,2010,Yes,The Controller of Her Majesty’s Stationary Office printed the final report as an 11-volume book series.,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-bloody-sunday-inquiry>,No,<https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/11-12/7/introduction/enacted>,"The Guardian. “Bloody Sunday Inquiry: Price of the Process,” June 11, 2010, sec.

110,615,0,Ad Hoc Inquiry Commission in Charge of the Question of Disappearances,Commission d’Enquête ad hoc chargée de la question des disparus (Ad Hoc Inquiry Commission in Charge of the Question of Disappearances),"The Ad Hoc Inquiry Commission in Charge of the Question of Disappearances was established by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on September 11, 2003, by Presidential Decree 03-299. Its mandate was for 18 months of operation to investigate the pattern of deaths, disappearances, civilian targeting, and other human rights crimes (child soldiers, rape, murder) during the period of la Guerre Sale, or Dirty War, 1992-1999. This was a period of civil war beginning with the military annulment of elections won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and subsequent military coup in 1992 that led to mass violence by state security forces, armed rebels, and state-sponsored militias. In 1999, democracy was renewed with the election of President Bouteflika, but this was less of a transitionary period than a shift back to the status quo. The COI reflects this fact by viewing its work as contextualizing the violent actions of a civil war, not a period of autocracy. The COI was aimed at addressing the fate of the more than 7,000 people who were forcibly disappeared and over 150,000 who were killed during the civil war. It was a streamlined continuation of former administrative bodies in the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Justice that were authorized to collect complaints about disappearances. It was established as a subsidiary organ of the National Consultative Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, established by Bouteflika’s Presidential Decree 01-71 in 2001. The COI’s fact-finding mission emphasized determining historical truth and the location of victims’ bodies in addition to a mission to establish dialogue with the families of disappeared in order to determine their needs and how those needs could be best met with various reparations. According to a speech inaugurating the commission on September 20, 2003, by President Bouteflika, the COI was also intended to support national reconciliation reflecting the state’s acceptance of full responsibility and intention to memorialize the disappeared, their families, and victims of human rights abuses. Presidential Decree 03-299 specified criteria for six commissioner seats. The commissioners were appointed by President Bouteflika based on merit from the existing pool of the National Consultative Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights commissioners. Farouk Ksentini was chosen as chairman of the COI. The COI was widely criticized by human rights NGOs, civil society, and the families of victims for its lack of powers to compel. While the COI could request testimony and access to certain government documents, it did not have the power to force perpetrators, witnesses, or victims to testify or force the government to provide documents for examination. Because of this limited empowerment, it met considerable stonewalling from government organizations controlled by administrations that sought to cover the role of the state in the civil war. In reality, it was intended to function as “interface” between victims, the families, and the governmental administration, but did not actually function as a commission of investigation. In this way, the COI was organizationally independent but not functionally independent from the rhetoric and narrative of events disseminated by Bouteflika’s administration. The gap between the underlying political intention of the COI to reflect positively on the administration and the testimony of events provided by victims, families, and witnesses impacted the results of the COI. The actual content of the report remains confidential to the President and thus is unknown, but the chairman Ksentini did acknowledge the state’s collective responsibility, although he also emphasized that the actions of local commanders were not authorized by their superiors. It can be assumed that it recommended a plan for reparations based on the fact that the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation followed shortly after the report’s submission. The Charter was approved by public referendum in September 2005, enacted by Presidential Decree 05-278 in February 2006 and implemented by Ordinance No. 06-02 in February 2006. While it did provide remittances, victims and their families felt this inadequate. They did not want financial compensation; they wanted information about the disappearances and/or systematic repressive violence by the military. The gap between the events experienced by victims and the events reported by the COI left the desires by victims and their families entirely unmet.",domestic,domestic law,President Abdelaziz Bouteflika,,USIP,2003,2003-09-11,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Algeria-Charter_Decree03_299.pdf>,completed,0,2003,USIP,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,1992-1999,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,USIP both Decree 03-299 and Bouteflika’s speech,partially independent,Yes,6,Appointed by President based on merit from existing pool of National Consultative Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights commissioners; chairman of the COI was Farouk Ksentini….

33,165,0,Parliamentary Investigative Commission on the Situation of Disappeared Persons and Its Causes (Comision Investigadora Parlamentaria sobre Situacion de Personas Desaparecidas y Hechos que la Motivaron),Parliamentary Investigative Commission on the Situation of Disappeared Persons and Its Causes (Comision Investigadora Parlamentaria sobre la Situacion de Personas Desaparecidas y Hechos que la Motivaron),"The Parliamentary Investigative Commission on the Situation of Disappeared Persons and Its Causes (hereafter the Investigative Commission) was established by the Uruguayan Chamber of Representatives on April 9, 1985 to investigate the cases of disappeared persons of Uruguayan nationality during the military dictatorship (June 1973 to March 1985) and the reasons behind these crimes. It worked for seven months, submitting to the Chamber of Representatives an interim report on July 16, 1985 and its final report on November 4 of the same year. This Investigative Commission was one of three such bodies (for the other two, see entries on the Investigative Commission on the Kidnapping and Assassination of Representatives Zelmar Michelini and Héctor Gutiérrez-Ruiz, and the Investigative Commission Requested by Senator Juan Carlos Blanco in Relation to His Conduct in the Ministry of External Relation in the Case of Elena Quinteros) instituted by the Uruguayan parliament in the 1985–1990 period to shed light on the grave human rights abuses perpetrated during military rule, when the Uruguayan regime submitted society to a reign of terror, employing systematic torture, mass prolonged imprisonment, and enforced disappearances (see entry on Uruguay). The question of disappearances featured early on in the democratic transition of Uruguay, being included on the parliamentary agenda one week after the new democratic parliament was installed on February 15, 1985. Shortly afterward, human rights became a thorny issue for the ruling Colorado Party, after victims and their families presented to the courts cases of crimes perpetrated by military and security forces during the dictatorship. The center-right Colorado government adopted a laissez-faire attitude toward truth and justice, while President Julio María Sanguinetti was ambiguous on the issue of accountability, stating that he would neither undertake official policies to ensure justice nor prevent individuals from approaching the courts (Barahona de Brito 2001, 127). At the heart of the government's National Pacification Project of March 1985 stood the release of all political prisoners, the social reintegration of returning exiles, and the restoration of public jobs to employees unfairly dismissed during the dictatorship. Amnesty Law 15,737 of 8 March 1985 provided amnesty for 210 political prisoners, and a civilian court review and subsequent commutation of sentence for another 62 political prisoners, including members of the Tupamaros, a radical left-wing urban guerrilla group that adopted armed struggle against the state in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. By the end of March, all 338 political prisoners had been released as a result of the Amnesty Law. Article 5 of the Amnesty Law explicitly excluded from its remit the crimes of inhumane, degrading, and cruel treatment, and the detention of those disappeared by military or police personnel. In early 1985, the Uruguayan armed forces opposed the idea of an amnesty for its members, believing it to be unnecessary because, in their opinion, they had committed no crimes, instead having “saved” the country from the communist threat. By late 1985, the Colorado government, which never championed accountability, also started to urge society to forget past crimes, to reconcile with perpetrators, and thus to move toward the future. Parliament began debating the question of an amnesty for the military only in October 1985. By December 1986, three bills seeking to limit or prevent prosecutions had been presented to the house, but none passed. Ultimately, however, Law 15,848 on the Expiry of the Punitive Claims of the State of 22 December 1986 ended the possibility of achieving justice and clarifying the past, coming to define the politics of transitional justice in Uruguay ever since. The Investigative Commission was preceded by a Pre-Investigative Commission, created by the Chamber of Representatives on February 21, 1985. It was composed of three legislators: Ramón Guadalupe (representing the opposition Broad Front), Juan Antonio Oxacelhay (representing the Blanco Party – opposition), and Ariel Lausarot (representing the ruling Colorado Party). This Commission concluded that the situation of disappeared persons warranted the establishment of an Investigative Commission, meeting the criteria laid out in Article 120 of the Constitution, regarding the “magnitude of the complaint,” “the seriousness of its origins,” and “the opportunity and source of an investigation” (Report 1985, 61). On April 9, 1985, the Chamber of Representatives considered the final report of the Pre-Investigative Commission and unanimously endorsed the creation of the Investigative Commission. Its founding document delineated the Commission's mandate, composition, and time frame. The Commission was to clarify the situation of disappeared people and its causes (Article 1). It would include eleven national representatives: five from the ruling Colorado Party, four from the opposition Blanco Party, and two from the opposition Broad Front (Article 2). These were: Francisco Forteza, Marcelo Antonaccio, Mario Cantón, Víctor Vaillant, and Hugo Granucci (Colorado); Nelson Lorenzo-Rovira and Eden Melo Santa Marina (Broad Front); and Oscar López-Balestra, Elías-Alberto Porras-Larralde, Alfredo Zaffaroni, and Edison Zunini (Blanco). Membership reflected the distribution of political parties in parliament. The Commission had ninety days to produce its report (Article 3). The Investigative Commission worked from April to November 1985. On July 16, 1985, it submitted to the Supreme Court and the executive an interim report, to transmit the material collected up to that point and to request a ninety-day extension of its mandate. In the interim report, the Commission distinguished disappearances that occurred in Uruguay from those that took place abroad, focusing on the former. The Commission received information from national and international organizations and from anyone else considered a reliable source of information. It acquired documentation from the UN Human Rights Committee, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Peace and Justice Service and the Institute of Legal and Social Studies in Uruguay, and the Center for Legal and Social Studies in Argentina. Seventy-five individuals gave testimony, including relatives of the disappeared and witnesses to the victims’ arrest or imprisonment. Senator Juan Raúl Ferreira, the son of Blanco Party leader Wilson Ferreira-Aldunate, also cooperated. Twenty-nine cases of individuals who disappeared in Uruguay were presented to the Commission, which reached four conclusions. First, it concluded that twenty-four Uruguayan citizens “physically disappeared from their homes, and no-one has since received any news about them” (Interim Report 1985, 512). Second, most cases occurred between 1975 and 1978. Third, most disappearances happened after the intervention of members of the Joint Forces (Fuerzas Conjuntas, a body including army and police units fighting subversion since 1971), who arrested and took them away from their homes. Many of those missing were seen for the last time when detained in military establishments. Fourth, the Commission found enough evidence that serious criminal actions had been committed to warrant the transmission of this information to the Supreme Court and the executive. The Chamber of Representatives agreed to pass on all the documentation to the Supreme Court and the executive, and granted the Commission the ninety-day extension it had requested. On November 7, 1985, the Commission presented its final report to the Chamber of Representatives. It included information on disappearances in Uruguay and abroad. The Commission recorded 132 cases of Uruguayans disappeared abroad, underscored the difficulty of its investigation, in terms of both the physical distance from where the events had occurred and access to information, and also noted that disappearances in Uruguay and Argentina were interconnected (see entry on Argentina). The report strongly condemned the use of enforced disappearances by the military regimes of Argentina and Uruguay, highlighting their cruelty and labeling them as worse than death (Final Report 1985, 516). Disappearances met the criteria of crimes against humanity, according to the Commission, which underscored the “lack of respect towards human beings, the total deprivation of identity and self-respect,” and the infringement of fundamental human rights that this specific crime embodied. Attention was drawn to the fact that the crime of disappearance began “at the very moment of kidnapping and continued in time, affecting not only the victims, but also their families” (Final Report 1985, 516). The report acknowledged the strong similarities between Argentina and Uruguay, concluding that political repression was the main cause of the disappearances, and recognized that the rule of law had been replaced by a regime of terror that employed torture, kidnappings, disappearances, and murder. It noted that most disappearances had been proven to be a direct consequence of the brutal treatment to which detainees were submitted. It decided, however, not to publicize any names, as only the judiciary, not a parliamentary commission, can initiate criminal proceedings. The Commission reached thirteen conclusions. On the basis of the information received, the Commission recorded 164 disappearances between 1973 and 1978. Of the disappeared, 118 were men, 38 were women, and 8 were children. Thirty-two disappearances occurred in Uruguay, 127 in Argentina, 3 in Chile, and 2 in Paraguay. The testimonies received clearly linked disappearances in Argentina and Uruguay, as Uruguayan military personnel worked in both countries. The Commission mentioned the case of twenty-two Uruguayans kidnapped in Argentina and clandestinely transferred back to Uruguay, where they were prosecuted and incarcerated. Torture in clandestine detention centers was a “common denominator” and suffered by all disappeared-detainees (Final Report 1985, 517). The disappeared adults had all died because of the brutal treatment they received or because they were executed, and thus the list of perpetrated crimes included brutal homicides with aggravating circumstances. (This conclusion was later left out, as the courts, not a parliamentary commission, had to establish whether each disappeared-detainee was dead). Several disappeared children were given to relatives of individuals belonging to the repressive apparatus, and others might have been killed. The Commission found insufficient evidence to demonstrate that these crimes and illegal conduct had resulted from institutional decisions, but solid evidence pointed to the involvement of military and police personnel, who were repeatedly mentioned in the testimonies received. In the case of one disappearance in Uruguay, “although the police and military high command appear to have been involved, motivations were more likely related to a settling of scores for personal reasons and related to common criminal activities” (Final Report 1985, 517). The Commission received the names of sixty-one Uruguayan military and three foreigners directly involved in kidnappings, disappearances, torture, and murder, and confirmed the existence of unmarked graves. The dates of the secret burials coincided with the period when most denounced disappearances occurred. According to the Commission, such events happen when “societies lose control of democratic institutions and the degradation of some individuals combines with impunity for their despicable actions.” It called on parliament to “raise its voice today for a people that, silenced by force at the time, could not denounce these deeds before the judiciary” (Final Report 1985, 517). The report noted that the parliamentary commission carried out the investigation within constitutional limits and was confident that the judiciary would rapidly and “definitively clarify these facts, judging and sentencing those responsible” (Final Report 1985, 517). On November 7, 1985, the Chamber of Representatives unanimously approved a resolution to denounce these crimes to the judiciary by transmitting the Commission's records to the courts, and to forward all the relevant documentation gathered by the Commission to the executive, together with the names of military and police personnel cited in them. Parliamentary Investigative Commission on the Situation of Disappeared Persons and Its Causes (Comision Investigadora Parlamentaria sobre Situacion de Personas Desaparecidas y Hechos que la Motivaron) in Uruguay was created by Parliament to inquiry into forced disappearances between 1973 and 1982. Its investigative mandate was very limited in scope and in terms of timeframe, making it not ""highly thought of"" (Justice in Perspective). The truth commission operated for a period of 7 months and reported on 164 cases of forced disappearances with 9 commissioners. The final report called the ""Informe Final de la Comision Investigadora sobre la Situacion de Personas Desaparecidas y Hechos que la Motivaron"" (Final Report of the Investigative Commission on the Situation of the 'Disappeared' People and its Causes) was released and concluded that the military in Uruguay was responsible for the forced disappearances.

There is no definition of what constitutes an “involuntary removal” in the warrants that created the commissions and the term has no legal meaning.

164,475,0,"The Judicial Commission of Inquiry for the Investigation of Human Rights Violations, aka the Oputa Panel","The Judicial Commission of Inquiry for the Investigation of Human Rights Violations, aka the Oputa Panel","Despite efforts to create a unified democracy after Nigeria attained independence from the U.K. in 1960, ethnic, religious, and social clashes led to violence and social upheaval. In 1966, thousands of ethnic Igbo were murdered in 1966 massacres, leading to a succession efforts and a civil war until 1970. Military coups in 1975 and 1983, as well as economic crises, impeded democratization and constitutional reforms. General Ibrahim Babangida annulled the elections of August 1993 to keep himself in power. Riots followed until Defense Minister Sani Abacha seized control of the government in November 1993. As dissatisfaction, ethnoreligious tensions, and fears of coup grew, Defense Minister Sani Abacha's security forces ordered secret trials that sentenced former leaders and opposition members to death. When Abacha died in 1998, Olusegun Obasanjo came into power and initiated a series of reform, including the creation of a Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission known as the “Oputa Panel”. The Commission was mandated by Statutory Instrument No. 8 of June 1999 pursuant to Section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry Act of 1990 but was later redefined by Statutory Instrument No. 13 of 1999, which renamed the Commission to the Judicial Commission of Inquiry for the Investigation of Human Rights Violations, clarified its mandate as all human rights abuses, abuses and gave the commission semi-judicial power. The Commission was anticipated excitedly by Nigerians with high expectations. It was made up of 7 commissioners including two women and presided over by the Hon. Justice Chukwudifa A. Oputa, a member of the Supreme Court. The Commission was expressly modeled on the South African TRC; it was empowered to offer amnesty (referred to by the Commission as “forgiveness”) to perpetrators who gave full confessions, could summon, subpoena, and issue warrants to enforce these powers. The commissioners even traveled to South Africa to meet with former TRC commissioners and discuss effective strategies. Prior to beginning public hearings, the commissioners also met with civil society groups to ascertain their needs and ideal outcomes for reconciliation. Allegedly, President Obasanjo attempted to sabotage the substantive capacity of the Commission in order to appease military and political elites and ensure his own power. This allegation is buttressed by the fact that Obasanjo only granted the Commission 90 days to complete its hefty mandate and did not provide sufficient financial support to the Commission, even refusing to provide further funding once the initial funding had run out. However, the Commission was granted permission to receive donations, and was able to complete its final report only due to a large grant from the Ford Foundation and other international donors. However, the lack of funding and bureaucratic red tape in the beginning of the Commission’s life deflated the high expectations of many Nigerians, including most media outlets, which were quick to denounce the Commission as another hollow institution. To change this opinion, the Commission established its Media Cooperation Unit, which became integral to the success of the Commission among average Nigerians. Prior to hearings, this Unit held regular press briefings about the petition process, spreading awareness that resulted in over 10,000 petitions. Ultimately, these close connections to the press led to the televising and radio coverage of the Commissions’ 200 public hearings. One source describes these hearings, which went on for more than a year in Abuja, Lagos, and Port Harcourt, as “religiously monitored” by the Nigerian public. This transparency went a long way to facilitate public confidence in the independence and impartiality of the Commission. The Commission’s main controversy regarded the failure to enforce the summons of three Generals— Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babagida, and Abdusalami Abubakar. The Commission claims that it chose not to issue warrants for these (known) perpetrators in the spirit of reconciliation. Overall, however, some of the most notable outcomes of the Commission took place in localities known for decades of ethnoreligious conflict. Remarkably, the Commission brokered a peace deal between the warring factions of Ogoniland, reconciled the Maroko Village communities, and facilitated the resolution of the communal conflict between Ife and Modakeke communities in Osun State. Its report was issued to the government in May 2002, and despite the government’s promise to share it with the public, it was never formally published. In January 2005, the Washington-based NGO Nigerian Democratic Movement and Nigeria-based Civil Society Forum took the initiative to unofficially publish the report. In it, the Commission concludes that the military is primarily responsible for the human rights violations, closely followed by the police, security agencies, and the complicit public bureaucracy. It recommends that the 150 cases that met its evidentiary standards from the 200 that it heard are prosecuted by the Attorney General, and that the cases remaining from the 10,000 petitions that were never heard are duly investigated by the appropriate administrative agency (to which the Commission forwarded those petitions). It also makes 32 other recommendations, largely in reference to security reform, efforts against marginalization via decentralization, a clarification of citizenship rights, and educational reform.",domestic,domestic law,Olusegun Obasanjo,,,1999,1999-06-14,,completed,0,1999,<https://dawodu.com/oputa2.pdf>,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"January 15, 1966 to May 28, 1999",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,<https://dawodu.com/oputa2.pdf>,fully independent,Yes,7,Appointed by President Obasanjo,No,Yes,,,<https://allafrica.com/stories/200206030488.html> <https://www.usip.org/publications/1999/06/truth-commission-nigeria> <https://www.zikoko.com/citizen/the-oputa-panel-never-released-its-report/> <https://dawodu.com/oputa2.pdf>,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,<https://dawodu.com/oputa2.pdf>,Yes,10000,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,https://networks.h-net.org/node/19206/discussions/3085374/human-rights-violations-investigation-commission-nigeria-20-years https://www.zikoko.com/citizen/the-oputa-panel-never-released-its-report/ https://dawodu.com/oputa2.pdf,2002,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,1,"150 perps who met the Commission’s evidentiary standard in its public hearings.

Oscillating ethnicities of prime ministers and cabinets after independence from the British in 1948 led to each administration enacting discriminatory legislation against the other ethnicity in an attempt to consolidate an ethnic monopoly on political power. This resulted in the Sinhala Only Act, which made Sinhala the official language, a symbolic act of Sinhalese majority oppression of the Tamil minority. Through the 1950s, successive presidents attempted to unite the country and put an end to ethnic grievances, but to no success. The manipulation of these grievances in electoral politics in the 1960s led to two problems: first, a youth crisis, which produced the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), and second, a growing militant sentiment among the Tamil in the North during the 1970s. The JVP, a Marxist-Leninist militant organization, staged an unsuccessful coup in 1971. In 1975, Tamil militants assassinated a local Sinhalese mayor, and in 1976, the ad hoc Tamil guerilla forces consolidated into the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Beginning in 1983, Tamil clashed with government security forces, resulting in race riots and increased organizational capacity—the LTTE received arms, food, and training from India (Tamils and India share Hindu nationalism) as it attempted to establish its own independent state. This is the official beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War, which would not end until 2009. In 1987, the Sri Lankan government and Indian government signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, which made significant concessions to Tamils, including the devolution of state authority and an open door for their future independence, but also authorized the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) to neutralize the LTTE. Exploiting this distraction and the widespread anti-Indian Sinhalese sentiment angry with the government for making concessions, the JVP launched a second insurrection. The LTTE-Indian violence and the Sri Lankan government-JVP violence caused widespread chaos, guerilla tactics, targeting civilian victims, and suicide bombs. The government response included widespread killings and “disappearances” of suspected insurgents. The government won a decisive military victory against the JVP by 1990. In a desperate hope for peaceful negotiated settlement, President Ranasinghe Premadasa ordered the IPKF to leave in 1990 and opened negotiations with the LTTE. Violence only increased, although it was more contained—the LTTE expelled the Sri Lankan Muslims in an act of ethnic cleansing. By the late 1990s, negotiations had begun. In 2002, the LTTE and Sri Lanka signed a ceasefire brokered by Norway. Violence continued until 2009. In 1995, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga created three “zonal” Commissions of Inquiry into the Involuntary Removal or Disappearance of Persons—one for the Central, North West, North Central and Uva Provinces, one for the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and one for the Western, Southern, and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. They all completed work in 1997, when President Kumaratunga created an “All Island” COI to synthesize their work and fill in remaining gaps. The “zonal” COI for the Central, North West, North Central and Uva Provinces was created by a Proclamation in Gazette 855/18 published on January 25, 1995. The COI was composed of three commissioners, Chaired by Thirunavukkarasa Suntheralingam Esquire. It only had four months to complete its investigations. It had a topic-specific mandate limiting the scope of inquiry to disappearances and arbitrary detentions, and it had limited powers, with no power to compel. The Commission was housed in the Superior Courts Complex of the Ministry of Justice in Colombo. It also held decentralized public hearings by partnering with district and provincial authorities. The ongoing civil war put the COI in extreme insecurity, a logistical obstacle that prevented the COI from inquiring into all of its received complaints and completing all of its planned hearings. In total, it received 15,045 complaints (roughly equivalent to the number of victims), of which it held inquiries into and heard testimony related to 6,443 cases. Although the final report was released to the public in 1998, it is not online with the other two zonal COI reports at http://www.disappearances.org/news/mainfile.php/reports_srilanka/. There does not appear to be a full text available, except perhaps in the archives of the Law and Society Trust of Sri Lanka. Information about and quotes from the final report are available at https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/39530093/sri-lankas-commissions-of-inquiry-law-society-trust. This source also summarizes the COI’s conclusions, which attribute responsibility mainly to the state security forces, name a few perpetrators, and note that “there appears to be very little progress in implementing the recommendations of the Commission especially with regard to the action to be taken against persons against whom credible material indicative of such persons being responsible for the removals and/or disappearances.” The COI’s primary recommendation, then, is criminal trials. It states, “most of the complainants do not seem to be interested in receiving compensation as much as seeing those responsible being punished.” Nonetheless, it makes recommendations for the financial compensation of victims’ families, scholarships for their children, death certificates, medical, psychological, and employment relief for those who escaped detainment or returned from disappearance, and property relief.",domestic,domestic law,Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,,,1995,1995-01-25,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-18.pdf>,completed,0,1995,,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,yes,yes,0,1,0,,1988-1994,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,6443,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-20.pdf> <https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/39530093/sri-lankas-commissions-of-inquiry-law-society-trust>,partially independent,Yes,3,"Named in the Proclamation, i.e. appointed by President Kumaratunga",No,Yes,,,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-18.pdf> <https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/39530093/sri-lankas-commissions-of-inquiry-law-society-trust>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-18.pdf>,Yes,6443,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SriLanka-Charter/SriLanka-Charter_855-18.pdf https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/39530093/sri-lankas-commissions-of-inquiry-law-society-trust,1997,Yes,The COI published its own report.,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,1,,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"1.

117,140,0,National Truth Commission,Comissão Nacional da Verdade (National Truth Commission) Narrative:,"The Brazilian dictatorship was established by a coup against President João Goulart April 1, 1964, orchestrated by the Brazilian military and certain conservative interest groups, such as the Catholic Church, business groups, and anti-communist civil society, and supported by the US government. It maintained its control through an incredibly strict constitution that restricted freedom of expression and political opposition, leading to a total censorship of media and mass, systematic human rights violations against dissidents, including illegal detention, kidnapping, forced disappearance, torture, rape, and exile. Nonetheless, the dictatorship was supported by many because of its achievement of the “Brazilian Miracle,” in which the economy grew 10% annually. As inflation grew with the oil crisis and Latin American Debt Crisis of the 1970s, the dictatorship’s popularity fell, resulting in rumors of shifting power. Reading the writing on the wall, the dictatorship enacted the Amnesty Law of 1979, which prevents the investigation, prosecution, and sanctioning of those state agents responsible for human rights violations in the context of the dictatorship. The opposition won a majority in Parliament in 1982, and in 1985 a democratic transition and new constitution were established. The legacy of the dictatorship endured, however, due to the Amnesty Law, which was declared as contrary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights yet upheld by the Brazilian Supreme Court as constitutional in 2010. In reaction, President Lula de Silva proposed a bill creating the Comissão Nacional da Verdade (National Truth Commission), although it was signed into law by President Dilma Rousseff on November 18, 2011. Law No. 12,528 established a wide mandate and powers of the NTC, including public hearings, witness protection, subpoena documents from public bodies, and issue summons for testimony, although the NTC did not have the power to enforce or compel these subpoenas and summons. That being said, Law No. 12,528 mandates that “it is the duty of public servants and the military to collaborate with the NTC.” Investigating violations that occurred 40 years ago is methodologically challenging due to the death or loss of memory of many witnesses, victims and perpetrators, leading report of the NTC to rely heavily on the National Archives, the Amnesty Commission, and the Special Commission on Political Dead and Disappeared, which were all previous attempts at reconciliation, memorialization, and/or reparation. New content included over 1000 witness statements, 80 public hearings, and 1,984 communications, including 1,072 requests for information, 289 complaints, 76 written testimonies, 106 suggestions, and 20 praises. The majority of these communications, testimonies, and hearings are publicly available via the NTC’s website and the National Archives Revealed Memories Project, in addition to the NTC Final Report. Released to the public on December 10, 2014, the Final Report is broken into three volumes. The first volume meets the enumerated purposes defined by Law No. 12,528 and prioritizes the historical facts of the dictatorial regime from 1964-85. The second volume presents texts, testimonies, and documents gathered by the NTC with reflections by advisors and researchers. The third volume is entirely dedicated to the 434 victims, revealing their lives and circumstances of deaths to emphasize the importance of non-recurrence and call out the Brazilian state and armed forces’ violations of human rights and public trust. The report explicitly lists and names 377 perpetrators, 196 of whom are still alive and have a mean age of 82. It emphasizes the state’s duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish these perpetrators and draws attention to the continued existence of structures that facilitate human rights violations and encourage the impunity of violators. It makes 29 recommendations, including that the state repeal the Amnesty Law of 1979 and the National Security Act, that the military explicitly recognize and acknowledge responsibility for the human rights violations, that the Armed Forces and police entrance exams and assessments are reformulated and curriculum modified to emphasize principles of democracy and human rights, that these principles be taught in public and private education, that the prison system is “dignified” with measures against torture, the abolition of severe processes that family must undergo to visit their incarcerated relatives, measures to strengthen public defenders, and the implementation of mandatory custody hearings. Additionally, the final report demands that celebrations of the anniversary of the coup or aggrandizing the dictatorship be made criminally illegal and that medals, street names, building names, etc. be retracted from those who committed human rights crimes, regardless of their status as living or dead. The NTC successfully carried out a massive truth-seeking documentation effort, but is still considered by many victims and onlookers as too little, too late. The Report “lacks originality” because it includes the contents of many texts and testimonies already existing in the National Archives, but this is not the fault of the NTC; its methodological complications mentioned above were compounded by the military and Ministry of Defense’s refusal to disclose new documents. The military maintains its lack of recognition and responsibility for the human rights violations and even attempted to prevent the dissemination of the NTC report through legal means. Realistically, as long as the Amnesty Law of 1979 looms, Brazilian victims will never be legally avenged on any widespread scale. However, the NTC and its report did put significant pressure on the Brazilian justice system to take action, especially in regards to the Supreme Court. Although this cannot be directly attributed to the NTC’s work, the Supreme Court did carry out two prosecutions of military and police violators: the first, in 2019, convicting former army sergeant Antonio Waneir Pinheiro Lima of rape and torture and the second, in 2021, convicting former police officer Carlos Alberto Auguosto for kidnapping. That being said, the conclusions and recommendations of the NTC’s report are endangered by the rhetoric of current President Jãir Bolsonaro, who publicly recalls with praise and nostalgia the military dictatorship.",domestic,domestic law,President Dilma Rousseff,,,2011,2011-11-18,<http://www.planalto.gov.br/CCIVIL_03/_Ato2011-2014/2011/Lei/L12528.htm>,completed,0,2012,Report and Law,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,"September 18, 1946 to October 5, 1988",1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,434,Report and Law <https://www.ictj.org/news/brazils-hour-truth-and-justice>,fully independent,Yes,7,"According to Law No. 12,528 “appointed by the President of the Republic, among Brazilians, of recognized reputation and ethical conduct, identified with the defense of democracy and constitutional institutionality, as well as respect for human rights.” Those who “hold executive positions in a party association… are unable to act impartially… [and/or] are in the exercise of a position in commission or in a position of trust in any sphere of public power,” cannot participate in the NTC.",No,Yes,255,,Report and Law,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Report and Law,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Report https://www.ejiltalk.org/12892/,2014,Yes,"The government of Brazil, National Truth Commission Library, available online through the International Cataloguing in Publication data service as well as NTC website at http://cnv.memoriasreveladas.gov.br/todos-volume-1.html.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,1,"377 named prosecutors, only 196 of whom are alive",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,"That the military explicitly recognize and acknowledge responsibility for the human rights violations, establish museums and other systems and institutions of memorialization to preserve memory of the dictatorship’s human rights violations, retract medals, street names, building and public institution names, etc. from those who committed human rights crimes but were hailed as “heroes” during the dictatorship",Report,No,Report and Law,"“CNV - Comissão Nacional Da Verdade - CNV - Comissão Nacional Da Verdade.” Accessed March 15, 2022. http://cnv.memoriasreveladas.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=571. “L12528.” Accessed March 15, 2022. http://www.planalto.gov.br/CCIVIL_03/_Ato2011-2014/2011/Lei/L12528.htm. “Outcomes of the Brazilian Truth Commission: Achievements, Failures and Challenges - NYU School of Law – CHRGJ.” Accessed March 15, 2022. https://chrgj.org/event/outcomes-of-the-brazilian-truth-commission-achievements-failures-and-challenges/. “The Report of the Brazilian Truth Commission: Late Truth without Justice?” Accessed March 15, 2022. https://www.ejiltalk.org/12892/.

143,55,0,The Grenada Truth and Reconciliation Commission,The Grenada Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"Grenada became self-governing in 1967, although the UK retained technical control. During this time, Eric M. Gairy of the Labour Party gained notoriety, ultimately being elected as Prime Minister. Grenada gained full independence from the UK on February 7, 1974. The ""transition"" to independence was marred by violence, strikes and controversy about Gairy's ascension to leadership. The New Jewel Movement (NJM) gained popularity as opposition to Gairy increased. With a Parliamentary majority achieved in 1976, the NJM felt it had a mandate to rule and staged a coup on March 13, 1979 while Gairy was out of the country. They proclaimed a new People's Revolutionary Government (PRG), naming Maurice Bishop the new Prime Minister and enacting anti-Western, socialist policy. Initially, they enjoyed popularity, but this declined as the economy was plagued by inflation. A military coup took power in in October 1983, killing Maurice Bishop and others. The coup was deposed less than a week later by the US Military on President Ronald Reagan’s order, turning over power to Sir Paul Scoon. There is speculation about the involvement of other foreign powers, including the UK. The events from independence onward were never reconciled and rarely discussed. To attempt to create a verified historical narrative and provide redress to victims, the Governor-General Sir Daniel Williams enacted the Commission of Inquiry Act September 4, 2001, creating the Grenada Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The mandate of the TRC was unlike other truth commissions in that it was more topically narrow. It is notable that the TRC was not intended to investigate all instances of human rights violations, but rather those surrounding specific “political events,” such as the coups and foreign invasion. It was composed of 3 commissioners and a secretariat staff. It was granted the powers to compel testimony, subpoena documents, and penalize those who failed to appear or produce the court-ordered documents. However, it suffered from inadequate logistical and financial arrangements, insufficient support staff, and some unwilling personnel. Due to the length of time separating the TRC’s establishment and the events it was investigating, witnesses were scarce, and memories had faded. This complicated witness testimony. Another methodological issue with testimony was the lack of anonymity and protection for witnesses from criminal prosecution, which deterred them from giving testimony because they feared stigmatization or legal repercussions. When witnesses raised concerns, the TRC requested clarification of its mandated ability to “recommend for indemnity” those witnesses who cooperate truthfully, and understood that it could recommend individuals for amnesty, but could not grant amnesty. Additionally, it was heavily set back by the Hurricanes Ivan and Emily. Its final report was submitted in March 2006. In the introduction, the commissioners admit that they had not found much additional information to that which was already known. This subpar start continues with exceedingly general recommendations, including symbolic and material reparations, judicial and security sector respect for human rights, and the establishment of a National Reconciliation Council with a broad mandate including civil society, youth, and other political actors. Overall, the TRC received 70 oral testimonies and several other written statements, which are available for review in its appendices. It also includes several secondary sources that discuss the TRC’s work in context. The majority of those secondary sources view the TRC somewhat negatively due to its disappointing impotence. The TRC is heavily criticized for its symbolic rather than practical approach, which did not recognize that while truth is indispensable for reconciliation, justice is also required. Furthermore, exactly what happened after foreign invasion in October 1983 is still essentially unknown; there is no conclusive series of events and the majority of prevalent narratives are speculation. Finally, the report, while publicly available, was expensive to buy. Thus, there was little dissemination of the report except by NGOs and other media.",domestic,domestic law,,,<https://truthcommissions.humanities.mcmaster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grenada-TRC-2001-Full-Report.pdf>,2001,2001-09-04,<https://truthcommissions.humanities.mcmaster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grenada-TRC-2001-Full-Report.pdf>,completed,0,2001,<https://truthcommissions.humanities.mcmaster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grenada-TRC-2001-Full-Report.pdf>,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"January 1, 1976 to December 31, 1991",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,<https://truthcommissions.humanities.mcmaster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grenada-TRC-2001-Full-Report.pdf>,fully independent,Yes,3,"Appointed by the Governor-General Williams, they had outstanding moral character or legal experience.",No,Yes,18,,<https://truthcommissions.humanities.mcmaster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grenada-TRC-2001-Full-Report.pdf>,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,<https://truthcommissions.humanities.mcmaster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grenada-TRC-2001-Full-Report.pdf>,Yes,81,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,https://truthcommissions.humanities.mcmaster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grenada-TRC-2001-Full-Report.pdf,2006,Yes,"The Ministry of Legal Affairs, Labour, and Local Government published the report for the Governor-General.",Yes,No,No,No,Yes,0,,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,"Memorialization: monument in St. Georges in memory of those who died on Fort Rupert, a public holiday to mourn and remember those lost in the events at Fort Rupert and search for their bodies.

194,500,0,"Commission of Inquiry into the Disappearances of People in Uganda since 25 January, 1971","Commission of Inquiry into the Disappearances of People in Uganda since 25 January, 1971","While a British protectorate, Uganda’s largest monarchy, Buganda, was given special status simply due to its size, economic weight, and disinterestedness in the rest of Uganda. When Uganda gained its independence from Great Britain in 1962, the monarchy of Buganda—called the Kabaka, at the time led by King Muteesa—and the special relationship between the Kabaka and the central government was preserved. Yet within Buganda, political divisions emerged between those who wanted to remain a dominant monarchy, represented by the Kabaka Yekka party, and those who wanted to join with the rest of the territory to become a modern unitary state represented by the Democratic Party. At the time of independence, there was no dominant party in the rest of Uganda, but skilled negotiator Milton Obote united non-Bugandan politicians under the auspices of the Ugandan People’s Congress, largely by bonding over the mutual desire to rectify the regional inequality that buttressed Buganda’s special status. Hiding this underlying motive for the purposes of unification, the UPC struck an alliance with the KY on the basis of a federalist system and won an overwhelming majority in the Parliament, which elected Obote Prime Minister. It is important to note that Ugandan politics are very tribal in nature; the multiplicity of ethnic groups had so far not complicated politics because of Obote’s nation-building rhetoric. But by 1966, the UPC was tearing itself apart. In the midst of infighting, the UPC’s underlying desire to infringe upon Buganda’s special status was revealed, prompting the KY to abandon its alliance. Infighting also prompted two factions to emerge: the Northern Nilotic and the Southern Bantu. Bugandans were ethnically Bantu, and naturally aligned with the South. Obote conducted mass arrests, disappearances, and violent raids against Bantu during the late 1960s, culminating in suspending the constitution, removing the ceremonial power of King Muteesa, and ordering General Idi Amin to attack the Kabaka palace. In 1967, Obote declared himself president and abolished the traditional kingdoms in a new constitution, which also empowered the military with quasi-policymaking functions. Already essentially ruling Buganda and issuing policy, General Idi Amin ousted Obote in a 1971 coup, and established a military junta that ruled for the next eight years. In addition to the repression of fundamental freedoms, he carried out mass killings and enforced disappearances during his rule—an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 Ugandans were killed by state security forces between 1971-79. In an attempt to whitewash his actions and legitimize his power and in response to demands from the families of the disappeared, Idi Amin enacted the Commission of Inquiry Act 1914 on June 30, 1974, which created the Commission of Inquiry into the Disappearances of People in Uganda since 25 January, 1971. The COI was only mandated to investigate enforced disappearances and the ultimate fates of the disappeared. Its final report, issued in December 1974, documents 308 victims of enforced disappearances revealed by the testimony of 545 individuals, including security forces. However, the COI completely lacked independence. The COI was directly subordinate to President Idi Amin, the very individual responsible for organizing the mass campaign of disappearances. Its four commissioners were appointed by Idi Amin without any form of consultation, and they included two police superintendents and a member of the Armed Forces—again, the very security forces responsible for carrying out Idi Amin’s order for disappearances. Third, the COI could not receive “hearsay evidence, which adversely affects the reputation of any person or that is to reflect in any way upon the character or conduct of any person.” Also, “opinion touching upon the character, conduct or motives of any person shall not be received in evidence.” This essentially prevented hearing evidence about perpetrators from anyone but the perpetrators themselves, and thus partially nullified the COI’s mandate to determine responsibility. Witnesses, while eligible for protection, not only would be revoked of this protection should they provide evidence that adversely affects another, but that person adversely affected by the evidence, i.e. the perpetrator, would be given the opportunity to cross-examine the witness. This further disincentivized witnesses from giving testimony, and even endangered witnesses by forcing a confrontation. The COI did overcome some of these issues, at least partially—it named hundreds of perpetrators in testimony while maintaining witness security. Nonetheless, the final report’s findings of responsibility sheds further light on the commissioners’ lack of independence. They find that the disappearances of Army members were “by way of mopping-up operations within the Army to deal with the dissenting elements and the pockets of resistance within the various Units… These mopping-up operations were, in our opinion, logical and natural events of the military take-over.” This justification of disappearances as par for the course of a military coup, and thus excusable, is completely biased toward the military regime and incompatible with respect for human rights. Although the commissioners do not find that the disappearances of police and civilians were “logical and natural,” and acknowledge that in most cases they were committed by members of the military, they also affirm that “there was no evidence where there was even the remotest suggestion that Your Excellency had directed the disappearance of any person or the annihilation of any ethnic group of persons.” Again, this is incredibly biased towards the Idi Amin’s military regime and historically inaccurate. Regardless of the commissioners’ distortion of events to benefit the regime, they were later targeted in reprisal by Idi Amin and the military, presumably for their recommendation the military should have less policy and policing power.",domestic,domestic law,President General Al-Haji Idi Amin Dada,,,1974,1974-06-30,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/resources/collections/truth_commissions/Uganda74-Report/Uganda74-Charter.pdf>,completed,0,1974,,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,“since 25 January 1971”,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,308,,not independent,Yes,4,"Named in Commission of Inquiry Act 1914, i.e. appointed by President Idi Amin.",No,Yes,2,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,,Yes,545,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,,1975,Yes,The COI itself published the report and handed one confidential copy to President Idi Amin.,No,,,,Yes,0,,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,No,,"United States Institute of Peace. “Truth Commission: Uganda 74.” Accessed March 31, 2022. https://www.usip.org/publications/1974/06/truth-commission-uganda-74. “A Truth Commission for Uganda?” University of Pretoria.

213,732,0,The National Committee for Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident,제주 4.3 진상조사위 (The National Committee for Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident),"After the surrender of Japan to the Allies in WWII, the 35-year Japanese occupation of Korea came to an end. The division at the 38th parallel marked Soviet-controlled North Korea and US-controlled South Korea. The military occupation in Korea was known as the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGK) and aimed to hold South Korean elections by 1948. Prior to and during WWII, the residents on Jeju Island were some of the most vocal activists in the Korean independence movement. Jeju was noted by the USAMGK for its peace after Japanese surrender, but the Jeju People’s Council came under the control of the Workers’ Party of South Korea (WPSK) by 1946. The WPSK represented many of the Jeju interest groups formerly supportive of the Korean independence movement. Uncomfortable with external forces permanently dividing the Korean Republic, the WPSK opposed the 1948 elections. Jeju residents and the WPSK organized a mass demonstration on March 1, 1947. Attempts by security forces to disperse the crowd only resulted in more protestors, and in an attempt to control the crowd, the Korean police fired indiscriminate shots, killing six and imprisoning WPSK members. This began a violent chain of events in which Jeju residents protesting this episode of police brutality rushed the prison where WPSK members were being detained, prompting more police brutality and the mass influx of 400 police to quell the violence on the island. Members of far-right paramilitary, the Seobuk Young Men’s Association (SYMA), also rushed to the island to assist the police and condemn the Jeju activists. In 1948, a WPSK general strike also turned violent, attacking government institutions. This prompted the Jeju uprising on April 3, 1948, which witnessed WPSK guerillas engaging in open conflict with the police and SYMA. Mass atrocities were committed, notably scorched earth policies and village massacres. The Korean governor of Jeju defected from his post, joining the guerillas and prompting hundreds of police, disillusioned with the atrocities they were being ordered to commit against their own, to do the same. In response, the USAMGK ordered a purge of WPSK sympathizers via summary execution. Then, a few months later, an entire regiment of the Korean army mutinied, refusing “to murder the people of Jeju” and killed their superiors. The newly elected President Syngman Rhee, embarrassed by this incident, proclaimed martial law in November 1948. This paved the way for carte blanche Korean war crimes; determined to eradicate the guerillas, the Korean army pursued them to the mountains, massacring and burning the villages they encountered on the way, and killed thousands of guerillas. Having finally stamped out the guerilla front, Korea held elections in Jeju in 1949, formally and symbollicaly establishing control over the island. For most of Korea’s history, the “Jeju Incident” has been characterized as a Cold War-era communist uprising triumphantly prevented by Korean and US collaboration. Local-level truth initiatives began in the 1990s, when families of the victims and Jeju citizens began to mobilize memorialization and investigation on their own. In February 1991, the Jeju Provincial Council established a Special Committee on the Incident, publishing a report in 1995 that documented a list of 14,125 vicitim names. This prompted greater student and provincial government mobilization, including the proposal of a bill in the National Assembly. Still, denial prevailed among political elites until Kim Dae-jung made it his 1997 presidential campaign promise to conduct the investigation. In fulfilment of this promise, he set up a preliminary investigation and memorial park, which helped build political momentum for a larger inquiry. Finally in 2000, parliament passed the bipartisan Special law for the Truth Investigation about the Jeju 4·3 Incident and Honoring Victims, signed into law by President Dae-jung on January 12. This mandate established a National Committee for Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident that was not adequately impartial. Chaired and “supervised” by the Prime Minister, its commissioners were more than half government Ministers and military representatives. Activists argued that it was “absurd to have so many commissioners from the military, who were responsible for the massacres,” resulting in multiple revisions and enforcement ordinances to the Special Law, which reduced the number of military and government ministers and expanded the number of legal and civil society representatives. The resulting mandate established a 20-commissioner Committee with a 2-year mandate to investigate the violent conflict, broadly defined, between March 1, 1947 to September 21, 1954. The Committee incorporated an investigation unit, which collected data, reports, and relevant documents from the Korean government, the US, Japan, and Russia. The Committee’s final report, published in 2003, notes that the US National Archives were especially helpful, granting it access to 800 materials. The archival contributions of the investigation unit were pivotal for the Committee—without the hard evidence presented in 3,019 materials, the conservative and pro-military elements of the Committee could have more easily justified siding with the military rather than the victims. A source also notes that “ironically, the conservatives’ challenges and consistent attacks contributed to the success of the commission’s activities. The challenge from inside and outside the commission made the members of the investigation unit more attentive to the details of the report and made them firmly base the report on concrete and indisputable evidence.” The Committee took 503 testimonies, including from military perpetrators, Korean residents in Japan, and US citizens, and documents 14,028 victims, although the final report notes that the actual victim count is much higher, up to 20,000 or 30,000. It finds that, depending on the source, ~80% of victims were killed by (US, Korean army, or right-wing paramilitary) anti-guerilla expeditions and only ~10% were killed by guerillas. Around 300 villages, 19,934 households, and 39,285 houses were destroyed. It claims that “the first responsibility lies on the Chief of the 9th Regiment and Chief of the 2nd Regiment for the Suppression Operations, burning down the mountainous villages… However, the ultimate responsibility goes to President Rhee Syng-man… [who] declared the Martial Law… and… directly ordered the Supression Operation in the January 1949 Cabinet meeting… The US Minitary Government and the Provisional Military Advisory Group are not free from [responsibility]… the US Army Colonel in Jeju directly commanded the Suppression operation.” It also attributes responsibility to the SYMA paramilitary, which is “believed to be one of the main reasons for the Incident.” Contained in the Annex, the Report also presents a statement from the President in October 2003 offering an official apology.

114,145,0,National Commission of Investigation of Disappeared Citizens,Comisión Nacional de Investigación de Ciudadanos Desaparecidos (CNICD) National Commission of Investigation of Disappeared Citizens,"The coups and subsequent dictatorships of 1964-82 most notably include those of René Barrientos Ortuño (1964-69), Hugo Bánzer Suárez (1971-78), and General Luis García Meza (1980-81). These dictatorships resulted in the forced disappearance, illegal detention, and torture of Bolivian academics, opposition figures, and dissenting citizens. The Barrientos and Suárez administrations selectively repressed corporatist groups based on their levels of dissent, leading to abuses against unions and labor leaders, peasant coalitions, student organizations, and clergy. Barrientos notably carried out the attack on socialist guerilla leader Che Guevara. After recent investigation, it has become apparent that Barrientos and Suárez received considerable clandestine funding and advice from the CIA and Nixon Administration as part of Operation Condor. General Meza, often called the Cocaine General, rose to power during the Suárez regime as the head of the most right-wing faction of the military. This faction was financially supported by an extensive system of bribes from narcotraffickers to guarantee their indemnity. After coming to power, Meza was notoriously violent against the socialist political movement moving across Bolivia, particularly through rural youths. Advised by former SS Nazi officers and other European neofascists, Meza continued funding his military regime through cocaine trafficking while severely restricting the press, outlawing all political parties, exiling opposition members, and repressing trade unions. In the context of the first democratic transition after almost 20 years of dictatorship, President Hernán Siles Zuazo (1982-85) established la Comisión Nacional de Investigación de Ciudadanos Desaparecidos (CNICD) to determine the location of forcibly disappeared people and investigate deaths during the Suárez and Meza dictatorships. Presidential Decree No. 19241 established a general outline for the commission, with a very broad topical mandate with no specific time period. It was granted limited powers, however, to access official documents and take testimony, but could not compel either of those actions. It was presided over by 9 commissioners from varying interest groups, including the executive, legislative, army, church, largest national union, press, and Red Cross. However, the Ministry of Justice in 2007 noted that the commissioners, as representatives of government authorities and civil society groups, were not necessarily independent from those institutions and exhibited their own motives and opinions about the Suárez and Meza regimes’ legitimacy. It was widely known and documented that the CNICD did not take adequate steps to document or investigate the cause of deaths and forcible disappearances. Despite receiving 155 citizen complaints of disappeared families and friends, these disappearances were not fully examined. Contrary to its mission, the CNICD focused instead on its own investigations, resulting in the discovery of a mass grave in La Paz containing the bodies of 14 political prisoners murdered during the Suárez regime, considered its largest discovery. It has been criticized for its lack of systematization of investigation, including a lack of antemortem descriptions from family and friends as well as a lack of postmortem forensic analysis. In addition, the CNICD was incredibly slow and impotent; it was dissolved in 1985 without having ever issued a final report despite working for nearly 3 years. Its files and archives were turned over to the Association of Relatives of Missing Detainees and Martyrs for National Liberty (ASOFAMD), which appears to be confidential. This left victims and families of victims feeling that no closure or truth had been attained. This feeling of futility was part of the logic behind establishing Bolivia’s second truth commission in 2016.",domestic,domestic law,President Hernán Siles Zuazo,,<http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/normas/buscar/19241>,1982,1982-10-30,<http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/normas/buscar/19241>,completed,0,1982,<http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/normas/buscar/19241>,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,No,,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,<https://www.lapaz.bo/memoria/comisiones-de-la-verdad/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/05/AMR1812912015SPANISH.pdf>,partially independent,Yes,9,"Presidential Decree 19241 stipulates that the following must be represented as commissioners: 1 executive representative designated by the Ministry of Interior, 2 legislative representatives designated by the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, 1 church representative, 1 Armed Forces representative, 1 union representative designated by the Bolivian Workers’ Central, 1 Permanent Assembly of the Human Rights Commission representative, 1 Red Cross representative, and 1 press representative",Yes,Unknown,,,<http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/normas/buscar/19241> ICHR document,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,<http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/normas/buscar/19241>,Yes,155,No,No,No,No,,,https://www.icrc.org/data/files/publications/es/folleto_retos-frente-desaparicion-personas-bolivia.pdf http://www.gacetaoficialdebolivia.gob.bo/normas/buscar/19241,1985,No,,No,,,,No,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,ICHR Document,No,,"OEA. “OEA - Organización de los Estados Americanos: Democracia para la paz, la seguridad y el desarrollo.” Text, August 1, 2009. https://www.oas.org/es/cidh/prensa/comunicados/2017/142.asp.

118,439,0,The Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Death of Norbert Zongo and His Four Companions,The Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Death of Norbert Zongo and His Four Companions,"In October 1987, Blaise Compaoré led a coup against President Thomas Sankara, to whom he had been a close adviser and had installed in a 1983 coup which he also helped organize. He was elected as President in 1991, in an election boycotted by the opposition in which only 25% of the electorate participated. He was reelected in unfree, unfair elections until 2014, when a popular uprising occurred in reaction to Compaoré’s attempt to amend the constitution to allow his reelection in 2015. This popular uprising was buoyed by a civil society and human rights movement that had been ongoing since the 1990s in reaction to the state’s systematic abuse of power, censorship, violence, and corruption. A major figure in this movement was Norbert Zongo, a well-known journalist, the founder and editor of the popular newspaper L’Indépendant and the founding member of the national human rights movement, the Mouvement Burkinabé des droits de l’homme et des peuples (MBDHP). He was best known for frequently criticizing President Compaoré and other government officials, and wrote controversial stories about the fight for democracy, corruption, and press freedom. He had survived several attempted murders until 13 December 1998, when he was killed. At the time, he had been investigating the death of a man named David Ouédraogo, the personal chauffeur of Francois Compaoré, the President’s brother and adviser. Ouédraogo and two others had been detained by the Presidential Guard (RSP) for petty theft and tortured, although Ouédraogo’s death certificate cited “illness” as his cause of death. Zongo published several stories with photographs of the three men’s wounds, which showed evidence of torture, and questioned why the RSP was involved in the first place (petty theft was the police’s jurisdiction) and what Francois Compaoré’s precise role had been. In December, Zongo was found burned on the side of the road near Sapouy with his brother, their driver, and two employees. The deaths became known as le drame de Sapouy, and disrupted commonplace civil and political norms; suddenly, the President could be openly criticized, tens of thousands of demonstrators were in the streets daily, and the property of political elites was fair game for vandalism and attack. These events shocked the political system; Compaoré’s government was near collapse not only from the strength of popular will, but also from the retraction of international donors as they sought to distance themselves from the delegitimized government. This pressure prompted Compaoré to establish the Commission of Inquiry into the Death of Nortbert Zongo and His Four Companions via Presidential Decree No. 98-0490/PRES/PM/MEF/DEF/MJ-GS/MATS on 18 December 1998. The Decree granted the COI considerable power to call witnesses, compel testimony, and compel the production of official documents from state agencies and officials. It gave only four out of 14 commissioner seats to government representatives, but the mass aggregate organization of civil society, known as the Colectif, had the upper hand due to the quickly changing political climate. It refused to participate in the COI unless certain conditions were met, including the release of political prisoners and more commissioner seats for civil society. This resulted in Decree No. 99-001 of January 1999, which modified the terms of the COI, designating only three of 16 commissioner positions for government representatives. After only three months of investigation, in March, the COI ordered the detention of several members of the RSP, but the Public Prosecutor partially refused, failing to detain high-ranked suspects. All were shortly released. The COI released its final report in May 1999. It discussed the systematic abuse of press freedom and impunity for security sector violations. It further concluded that Zongo was assassinated “for purely political reasons because he practiced committed investigative journalism,” named 6 RSP suspects, and made recommendations, including that a special magistrate be appointed for the prosecution of these suspects. The Colectif and MBDHP endorsed the report, which was published by the government, reprinted in national newspapers, and translated into local languages and printed again in local newspapers. The realities of the report led to a fresh round of protests. In response to the COI’s recommendations, the Compaoré government established a special magistrate as well as the Collège des Sages, a group of elders with the explicit goal of reconciliation, rather than truth-seeking. On 18 January 1999, François Compaoré was charged with the murder of David Ouédraogo and with harbouring his body. He was not, however, arrested or detained and the charges against him were not made public until 30 March. The following day, after François Compaoré had requested that the charges against him be withdrawn, the Criminal Appeal Court in Ouagadougou ruled that it was not competent to hear the case and referred it to a military court. Similarly, in 2000, three of the six RSP perpetrators named in the report were found guilty of killing David Ouédraogo, but not prosecuted for the killing of Zongo. This sparked outrage, and in 2001, the special magistrate charged one of the three, Marcel Kafando, with the death of Zongo. But the case was dropped by the Prosecutor, and the Court of Appeal confirmed the dismissal. In March 2014, Zongo’s case was brought before the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which ruled that the Burkinabe government had failed to protect freedom of expression and did not diligently investigate these murders.",hybrid,domestic law,President Blaise Compaoré,,,1998,1998-12-18,,completed,0,1999,,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,No,,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,<https://www.pulp.up.ac.za/component/edocman/national-commissions-of-inquiry-in-africa-vehicles-to-pursue-accountability-for-violations-of-the-right-to-life>,fully independent,Yes,11,There was mandated space for three government representatives appointed by Compaoré; three representatives appointed by local human rights organizations; a representative of the family of each of the five victims; and five international representatives of international journalism organizations,Yes,Yes,32,,<https://www.pulp.up.ac.za/component/edocman/national-commissions-of-inquiry-in-africa-vehicles-to-pursue-accountability-for-violations-of-the-right-to-life>,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://www.pulp.up.ac.za/component/edocman/national-commissions-of-inquiry-in-africa-vehicles-to-pursue-accountability-for-violations-of-the-right-to-life>,Yes,200,No,No,Yes,No,,,https://ifex.org/norbert-zongo-case-continuation-of-the-inquiry/ https://www.pulp.up.ac.za/component/edocman/national-commissions-of-inquiry-in-africa-vehicles-to-pursue-accountability-for-violations-of-the-right-to-life,1999,Yes,The COI itself published its report.,Yes,,,,Yes,1,"The six named RSP suspects, Christophe Kombacere, Ousseini Yaro, Wampasba Nacoulma, Banagoulo Yaro, Edmond Koama and Marcel Kafando.

128,155,0,"Commission for the Qualification of Disappeared Detainees, Political Executions, and Victims of Political Imprisonment and Torture, commonly referred to as the Valech II","Comisión Asesora para la calificación de Detenidos Desaparecidos, Ejecutados Políticos y Víctimas de Prisión Política y Tortura, en común referido como la Comisión Valech II (Commission for the Qualification of Disappeared Detainees, Political Executions, and Victims of Political Imprisonment and Torture, commonly referred to as the Valech II","There have been two previous commissions to investigate the politically-motivated human rights violations of General Augusto Pinochet’s military coup and subsequent authoritarian regime 1973-90. During this time, the military and militarized police force enjoyed full impunity due to their association with Pinochet and maintained they were fighting an “internal war” to justified widespread illegal imprisonment, disappearances, assassinations, torture including sexual violence, and kidnappings. The first Chilean Truth Commission, la Comisión Nacional de Verdad y Reconciliación, which was also called the ‘Rettig Commission’ (1990-1991) made significant contributions to historical narrative by removing the impunity of the military, but it was limited and did not include political violence or human rights violations that did not result in death. This generated the need for a second Chilean Truth Commission, la Comisión Nacional Sobre Prisón Politica y Tortura, which was also called the ‘Valech Commission’ (2003-2004). This Commission made far greater strides by incorporating into its mandate those violations that did not result in death, bringing the number of victims up to 28,459. Based on the success of the Valech Commission, the Chilean legislature followed many of its recommendations, including creating a National Institute for Human Rights (INDH). During the period in between the completion of the Valech Commission’s report and the legislation of the INDH, several new victims came forward and/or were revealed through the judicial system’s prosecution of violations. Many of the victims whose cases were heard and rejected by both the Rettig Commission and Valech Commission also sought review of their claims. Thus, the Chilean legislature opted to “readapt” the Valech Commission into the same Law that established the INDH, Law No. 20.405 of November 24, 2009. Hence, the legislature simultaneously created the INDH and a third Chilean Truth Commission named la Comisión Asesora para la calificación de Detenidos Desaparecidos, Ejecutados Políticos y Víctimas de Prisión Política y Tortura. This Commission was commonly referred to as the Valech II Commission because it was structured nearly identically to the first Valech Commission and presided over by the same set of commissioners, headed by Monsignor Sergio Valech Aldunate. Valech II, like the rest of the Chilean Truth Commissions, investigated violations between September 11, 1971 to March 10, 1990. It was a body of the executive, and thus could not take on a judicial character by assigning responsibility for violations. According to Supreme Decree No. 43 of January 27, 2010, in which President Michelle Bachelet formally initiated Valech II, it possessed the power to investigate state agents and access documents, including the testimonies of the first Valech Commission, which were protected from public, legislative, and judicial access for 50 years according to Law No. 19.992. The first Valech Commission testimonies were re-archived for 50 years and the Valech II testimonies were also afforded this protection when Valech II published its final report and dissolved. However, Valech II did not have the power to recommend institutional reforms. Its investigative methodology was the same as the first Valech Commission, with subnational counterparts to take testimony. Initially, Valech II received 32,453 declarations from victims, 622 of which were new cases, 159 of which were Rettig cases seeking reconsideration, and 1,912 of which were Valech cases seeking reconsideration. Valech II and its subnational counterparts also received 224 oral testimonies. Ultimately, Valech II determined that 30 detainees or politically-motivated executions and 9,795 victims of political imprisonment and torture were overlooked by the Rettig and first Valech Commissions, bringing the total number of victims up to 38,284. In the Valech II report, the Commission concludes that the Carbineros conducted the most arbitrary arrests (40.97%) of any military or police force; that most victims were imprisoned more than once (only 24.3% were only imprisoned once); and that students were the group against whom the most violations were committed (27% of political imprisonment and torture committed against students). Additionally, the report reiterates that the majority of violations occurred during the year of Pinochet’s coup, 1973. The report does not make recommendations, but according to Law No. 20.405 and Supreme Decree No. 43, the additional 9,825 victims must be automatically entered into the reparations systems established by Law No. 19.992.",domestic,domestic law,President Michelle Bachelet,,<https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1008867&idVersion=2019-10-26&idParte=8813353>,2009,2009-12-10,<https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1008867&idVersion=2019-10-26&idParte=8813353>,completed,0,2010,<https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1008867&idVersion=2019-10-26&idParte=8813353>,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,"September 11, 1971 to March 10, 1990",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,38284,<https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1008867&idVersion=2019-10-26&idParte=8813353>,fully independent,Yes,8,"The Valech II commissioners were chosen by their previous positions as commissioners in the first Valech commission.

119,516,0,"International Commission of Inquiry into human rights violations in Burundi since October 21, 1993","Commission d'Enquête Internationale sur les violations des droits de l'homme au Burundi depuis le 21 octobre 1993 (International Commission of Inquiry into human rights violations in Burundi since October 21, 1993)","Burundi has a long history of ethnic conflict between minority Tutsis and majority Hutus. Due to Belgian colonizers’ active favoritism toward Tutsis for administrative positions and discrimination against Hutus, Tutsis continued to dominate the government after Burundian independence in 1962. Fed up with the status quo, Hutu army officers attempted a coup against the Tutsi government in 1965 but failed, resulting in Tutsi revenge and mass violence as Hutus formed armed factions and used guerilla tactics. This conflict resulted in the systematic murders of an estimated 150,000 Hutus and forced exile of thousands of others in 1972. This violence continued through 1988, when political pressures mounted against the Tutsi government. Hutu intellectuals and those in exile formed several movements for change that forced Tutsi President Buyoya to alter the constitution to allow multi-party elections. The subsequent election of Hutu President Melchior Ndadaye was hailed as a signal of plurality in the future, but Ndadaye was assassinated by Tutsi military officers on October 21, 1993. This can be considered the beginning of formal civil war; the Tutsi-dominated military and Hutu paramilitaries were engaged in full-scale battles by the end of the year. The actions and events surrounding Hutu systematic killing of Tutsis in 1993 qualify as genocide. On April 6, 1994, the newly appointed Burundian Hutu president and Rwandan Hutu president were killed when their plane was shot down, prompting the Rwandan genocide, which only inspired more division and Hutu confidence to massacre Tutsis. The UN Security Council coordinated the Preparatory Fact-Finding Mission to Burundi (S/1995/157) and a Judiciary Commissioner of Inquiry (Pedro Nikken S/1995/631), which was established in response to a formal request from the Government of Burundi to determine the best approach to establish a human rights COI. The UNSC also mediated the Convention of Government (S/1995/190), in which 9 out of 13 parties agreed to a 25-member, 55% Hutu government appointed by the President with an opposition Prime Minister, 4-year transitional period, and 10-person equitably divided National Security Council. Among other reports, letters, etc., these context operations prompted the UNSC to pass Resolution 1012 on August 28, 1995 empowering the COI to determine the truth and facilitate reconciliation in preparation for an accountable, peaceful government. The COI was set up with 5 well-respected commissioners and staff and was granted a wide mandate, but nearly nonexistent powers. With no judicial powers to compel testimony, no power to compel government documents, and no resources to facilitate investigation, the COI was born impotent. It sought to establish the nature, pattern, and scope of human rights violations rather than conduct a detailed investigation, as identifying ever crime and every perpetrator would have been nearly impossible given the tens of thousands of perpetrators and violations. Its purpose was solely to amass evidence for ultimate prosecution or later judicial action. This already limited methodology was even further stunted by the lack of security on the ground. Since commissioners and their staff were required to travel to request testimony from certain individuals or members of certain ethnic groups, the completely unsafe nature of such travel seriously hindered hearing testimony. The COI’s facilities were surrounded by gunfire and shot into within two months, forcing the commissioners and staff to operate from their hotels, where resources were totally inadequate. That being said, Burundian judicial authorities were sympathetic to these methodological obstacles and gave considerable support to the COI, including granting access to court and prosecution records and allowing COI officials to speak with prisoners, IDPs in camps, and marginalized collines by providing escorts. The military and Ministry of Defense records, however, remained persistently closed despite multiple COI requests for review. The COI’s report, S/1996/682 was submitted to the UNSC in August 1996 and emphasizes that there is no “miraculous solution” possible for the “constant deterioration of the situation in Burundi.” However, it also reports that media coverage and UNSC efforts that focus on power redistribution amongst the military and political elites ignore the “basic problem[s]” of resettling tens of thousands of IDPs or reaching essential developmental goals such as food, jobs, and population growth. It recommends an end to impunity via judicial and legal reforms removing systemic bias for Tutsis, including revising penal codes, balancing ethnic representation in judge appointments, and providing basic legal aid to judges and prosecutors. However, again, the report remarks that such judicial reforms are impossible and should not be prioritized while the ever-present fear of being killed by members of the other ethnic group remains a reality. Finally, the report recommends that a case be opened in international jurisdiction regarding the genocide committed by Hutus against Tutsis after President Ndadaye’s death in 1993. Such international legal action, according to the report, must occur after the situation abates and “once a reasonable level of order and security and ethnic harmony are reestablished” in Burundi. The report recommends only prosecuting superior, authoritative, and/or elite perpetrators and offering amnesty or reduced sentences to those who were “merely ordered or led” due to the impracticality of prosecuting hundreds of thousands of citizens of both ethnic groups.",international,international law,International Body - UN Security Council,,,1995,1995-08-28,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Burundi-Charter.pdf>,completed,0,1995,<https://www.usip.org/publications/1995/09/commission-inquiry-burundi>,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,,,0,1,0,,,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,,<https://www.usip.org/publications/1995/09/commission-inquiry-burundi>,fully independent,Yes,5,"According to S/1995/1012, the COI would be composed of “five impartial and internationally respected, experienced jurists who shall be selected by the Secretary-General and shall be furnished with adequate expert staff.”",Don't know,Yes,19,,<https://www.usip.org/publications/1995/09/commission-inquiry-burundi>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://www.usip.org/publications/1995/09/commission-inquiry-burundi>,Yes,667,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,https://www.usip.org/publications/1995/09/commission-inquiry-burundi,1996,Yes,UN Security Council,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,1,"Superior, authoritative, and/or elite perpetrators, because, if prosecutions occur, it is practically impossible to prosecute hundreds of thousands of citizens of both ethnic groups, thus Burundi must offer immunity or reduced sentence in exchange for cooperation to those who were “merely ordered or led” ; recommends opening an ICC case for the acts of genocide against the Tutsi minority after the situation abates and “once a reasonable level of order and security and ethnic harmony are reestablished”",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,,<https://www.usip.org/publications/1995/09/commission-inquiry-burundi>,No,,"Secretary-General, Un, and UN Security Council Preparatory Fact-Finding Mission to Burundi (1994 Mar. 22-Apr. 20). “Letter Dated 95/02/24 from the Secretary-General Addressed to the President of the Security Council.,” February 24, 1995. https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/176257.

146,91,0,National Commissioner for the Protection of Human Rights,"Comisionado Nacional de la Protección de los Derechos Humanos, CONADEH (National Commissioner for the Protection of Human Rights)","A civilian government gained control of Honduras in 1979 after decades of military rule. The civilian government is accused of supporting the anti-communist Contra rebels in Nicaragua in exchange for U.S. military and economic aid. During this time, an alleged death squad known as Battalion 3-16 was accused of capturing, interrogating, torturing, and even executing suspected opposition leaders in Honduras. Battalion 3-16 was rumored to be trained and equipped by the United States CIA, although both the US and Honduran governments denied Battalion 3-16’s existence. In 1987, five Latin and Central American state signed the Esquipulas II Peace Accord, which enabled the region to end violent, largely Cold War-related conflict. The Honduran President during this quasi-judicial period, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, created an ombudsman, el Comisionado Nacional de la Protección de los Derechos Humanos, CONADEH (National Commissioner for the Protection of Human Rights), June 8, 1992 through Decree No. 26-92. Later, Decree No. 51-92 of September 8, 1992 guaranteed the Commissioner's “absolute independence in the performance of his duties.” CONADEH was essentially an executive ministry and was only required to report to the executive directly. Later, in 1995, it would be incorporated into legislative oversight and would be required to report to the Honduran National Assembly as well. It was granted an extremely broad mandate to investigate and respond to any requests from victims or evidence of human rights violations order to perpetuate respect for human rights, prevent their violation, and make recommendations to that effect. The first ombudsman, Leo Valladares Lanza, conducted an inquiry into Battalion 3-16 and the hundreds of Hondurans who disappeared 1980-1993. This was largely in response to the urging of families of victims who were being ignored by other arms of the Honduran state, including the judiciary, in an effort to “turn the page.” This inquiry was not specifically mandated by the government; Valladares technically violated the future-looking mandate of CONADEH by investigating violations from the past. While he did not enjoy assistance from relevant authorities, complicating logistics, his independent study did mean that Valladares enjoyed the highest degree of autonomy and flexibility. In order to facilitate his investigation, Valladares worked closely with the IACHR and gained access to some of their archives of Battalion 3-16 perpetrator testimony regarding systematic disappearance. This perpetrator testimony is available in his report, published in 1993. Valladares also traveled around Honduras to speak with families of the disappeared and other victims, but little information is known about this testimony; none of it is included in the report and there is no estimate of the number testimonies taken. However, Valladares does list 179 names of disappeared persons, their personal data, the context of their disappearance, and the names (if available) of the suspects implicated in their disappearance. However, Valladares also stresses that his CONADEH office has no judicial jurisdiction and thus cannot attribute responsibility to these individuals. Instead, he attributes responsibility to the Honduran state, specifically the judicial branch, for failing to investigate these episodes of disappearance despite persistent calls from families. He also attributes responsibility to the US, which he concludes is intentionally obscuring the truth. With this in mind, Valladares makes recommendations, including establishing a truth commission, security sector reform, reparations, prosecutions of those mentioned in the report, educational reform, judicial reform to respect due process, especially habeas corpus, and the establishment of two commissions, one for the allocation of reparations and another for locating mass graves/clandestine cemeteries. Most of these recommendations were not implemented, although Honduras did establish a follow-up Truth Commission in 2010. Additionally, several prosecutions were taken, including 10 military officers by Honduran Courts and others by the IACHR, which also ruled in 2004 that Honduras was required to issue reparations. No reparations plan has been articulated, however. The US also declassified documents about action in Honduras in 1982 and 1984, shedding additional light on the US-Nicaragua-Contra-Battalion 3-16 relations.",domestic,domestic law,President Rafael Leonardo Callejas,,,1992,1992-06-08,https://www.usip.org/publications/2012/02/commission-inquiry-honduras-93,completed,0,1993,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,0,1,No,,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,179,,fully independent,Yes,1,Appointed by President Rafael Leonardo Callejas according to merit,No,Yes,5,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,,Yes,,No,No,Yes,Unknown,,,,1993,Yes,"?

120,516,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Commission de Verité et Reconciliation (Truth and Reconciliation Commission),"In the early negotiations for an end to Burundi’s 1993-2005 civil war, former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa facilitated discussion attempting to reach an agreement for coexistence between Hutus and Tutsis. It was equally as important to convince the Hutus that peace was an alternative means to achieve their sociopolitical goals as it was to convince the Tutsis that peace was impossible without letting go of their positions of elite control preserved since colonialism. However, this was extraordinarily murky territory due to the history of human rights violations, institutionalized violence, and ethnic genocide between the groups. The negotiations were fruitful, however, and resulted in the 2000 Arusha Accords, which establish a plan for peace through power sharing formulas and reconciliation mechanisms, including a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The TRC envisioned by the Arusha Accords would function during the first transition period (ending in 2004) with a wide mandate, since Burundi’s independence in 1962 to date, to clarify history, recommend institutions and measures to promote forgiveness, issue reparations, and take actions against indemnity by amassing evidence for prosecutions. However, this TRC never materialized due to the ruling party’s (CNDD-FDD) pushback claiming that they did not sign the Arusha Accords and thus were not bound to its conditions. In 2004, the UN sent a mission to assess the viability of setting up a TRC as per the Arusha Accords. UN Security Council Resolution 1606 (2005) recommends a body to “establish the historical facts of the conflict, determine its causes and nature, classify the crimes committed since independence in 1962, and identify those responsible,” and a special chamber within Burundi’s judicial system which would “prosecute those bearing the greatest responsibility for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes”. Fundamental disagreements between the Burundian government and the UN regarding how the TRC and proposed Special Tribunal should be set up prolonged the process until 2011, when President Nkurunziza announced that the TRC would finally be created in 2012. In October 2011, President Nkurunziza issued a decree establishing a Technical Committee, to propose a draft law on the mandate, composition, and functioning of the TRC. This draft was amended and adopted by Parliament on April 17, 2014 and promulgated by President Nkurunziza May 15, 2014 as Decree-law No. 1/18. The content of this document is not available, however, it is clear that the law abandoned the idea of a Special Tribunal, reflecting CNDD-FDD’s interests, as the former largest Hutu rebel group, to preserve impunity from prosecution. Additionally, the law abandoned the tripartite (UN, civil society, and Burundi government) appointment of commissioners, thus reducing its efficacy and inclusivity. According to organizational structure set forth Decree-law No. 1/18, the commissioners would involve political actors with no international presence. That being said, the specific mandate of the Decree-law are to establish historical truth in relation to ethnic violence and make reparations when Burundi’s financial means allow. The TRC was originally only intended to exist for four years (until 2018), with one one-year extension, but in late 2018, the TRC’s mandate was extended for four years (until 2022) and its jurisdiction extended to cover all violations committed since 1885. So far, it has not covered significant actions and events in the civil war, such as the assassination of 8 assassinations and/or assassination attempts of parliamentarians. However, it has traveled across the country to take testimony from 374 people, find more than 4,000 mass graves, exhume 1,455 victims of the 1972 massacre for identification, and has identified 142,505 victims overall. The TRC issued a progress report in 2020 with conclusions regarding the 1972 massacre, demanding that the government issue a public apology. The TRC was shrouded in public distrust due to the successive political power grabs of CNDD-FDD, including attempting to discontinue the vice president post and end the power-sharing coalition that had been in place since the Arusha Accords. After February 2014, CNDD-FDD effectively controlled Burundi alone. From the perspective of opposition, civil society, and NGOs, the TRC was a tool to legitimize the CNDD-FDD and create a façade of reconciliation in anticipation for the 2015 elections, which were boycotted by opposition due to President Nkurunziza’s scheme for a third term. This theory is supported by the timing of the TRC; after a decade of stalling, the CNDD-FDD finally created the TRC after achieving a majority in Parliament from the 2010 elections. Opposition parties and civil society were excluded from both the Technical Committee and the TRC legislative process. The CNDD-FDD unilaterally designated the 11 commissioners, who were criticized for their conflicts of interest (4 were politicians) and lack of transitional justice or legal knowledge (5 were representatives of religious communities). Indeed, Secretary-General Clotilde Niragira was justice minister during a massacre while TRC President Jean-Louis Nahimana was a victim of 1972 violence, prompting concerns that they would be biased toward some cycles of violence and even try to repress evidence for others. Further, the TRC focused until 2021 on the 1972 massacres, which primarily targeted Hutus. These were incredibly disturbing events, but prioritizing them only fuels the accusations that the TRC is attempting to disseminate a narrative in favor of Hutus. There are considerable concerns that the extension of the mandate to colonialization and the focus on violence solely against Hutus is an attempt to “remobilize Hutus”. The TRC has not responded to these concerns.",domestic,domestic law,President Nkurunziza,,<https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/analysis/2014/07/17/burundi-s-troubled-peace-and-reconciliation-process>. <https://books.google.com/books?id=WpwuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT81&lpg=PT81&dq=17+april+2014+burundian+parliament+truth+and+reconciliation&source=bl&ots=VEhT5Cwe23&sig=ACfU3U2ph4Xkg_rpNdz8x7-_-wHiVUzjKw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjG2t3_7cf3AhVhlmoFHe9NDK0Q6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=17%20april%202014%20burundian%20parliament%20truth%20and%20reconciliation&f=false>,2014,2014-05-15,,ongoing,0,2014,<https://books.google.com/books?id=WpwuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT81&lpg=PT81&dq=17+april+2014+burundian+parliament+truth+and+reconciliation&source=bl&ots=VEhT5Cwe23&sig=ACfU3U2ph4Xkg_rpNdz8x7-_-wHiVUzjKw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjG2t3_7cf3AhVhlmoFHe9NDK0Q6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=17%20april%202014%20burundian%20parliament%20truth%20and%20reconciliation&f=false>,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"? 1962-2005, extended in 2018 to 2005-2018",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,142505,<https://books.google.com/books?id=WpwuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT81&lpg=PT81&dq=17+april+2014+burundian+parliament+truth+and+reconciliation&source=bl&ots=VEhT5Cwe23&sig=ACfU3U2ph4Xkg_rpNdz8x7-_-wHiVUzjKw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjG2t3_7cf3AhVhlmoFHe9NDK0Q6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=17%20april%202014%20burundian%20parliament%20truth%20and%20reconciliation&f=false> <https://static.wixstatic.com/ugd/f3f989_fad40f899c3046948025cc51f099adfc.pdf> [https://www.africanews.com/2021/03/20/burindi-s-truth-and-reconcilliation-commission-presents-new-findings//](https://www.africanews.com/2021/03/20/burindi-s-truth-and-reconcilliation-commission-presents-new-findings/) <https://thisisafrica.me/politics-and-society/truth-reconciliation-burundi/>,not independent,Yes,11,"Appointed by legislature and President by merit.

149,860,0,The Commission of Truth and Friendship,Comissão Verdade e Amizade (The Commission of Truth and Friendship),"East Timor remained a Portuguese colony until the fall of its military dictatorship in 1974 to a popular movement for democracy. After a small civil war due to political instability in the power vacuum left by the Portuguese, East Timor declared its independence. However, as it became increasingly apparent that the Timor government would be left-leaning, Indonesia, influenced by the Cold War politics of the decade, inaugurated Operation Komodo, which aimed to integrate East Timor into the Indonesian territory. Indonesia began with a propaganda campaign, but as it faced backlash and rejection, conflict developed into a full-on invasion, including militarized attacks against border security, naval attempts against large cities, and take-overs of small villages. Unsurprisingly, this was accompanied by deprivation of civilian rights and intentional violation of civilians as a weapon. While the UN condemned the invasion, no further action was taken due to tacit support from the US, who viewed the invasion as in furtherance of containment. Indonesia occupied East Timor December 1975-October 1999. During this period, Indonesia subjected pro-independence opposition to systematic torture, sexual slavery, extrajudicial killing, arbitrary detention, and intentional starvation. The Commission for Reception, Truth, and Reconciliation in East Timor estimates that 90,800 to 202,600 Timor people died out of a population of approximately 823,386. Several pro-independence paramilitaries (CNRT) kept the independence movement strong while simultaneously exacerbating the Indonesian’s justification for repression. In 1999, after the end of the Cold War, Indonesia bowed to internal and external political pressures and organized a referendum for independence. Despite this seemingly victorious moment, anti-independence paramilitaries undertook a final wave of violence, destroying most of the country’s infrastructure until Australia intervened, and the UN established a transitional administration (UNATET). In 2002, Timor-Leste officially became fully self-governing. Today, the actions of Indonesia in Timor-Leste are widely considered genocide. There have been several attempts at truth and justice between Timor-Leste and Indonesia. The Indonesian National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM) appointed a Commission of Inquiry (KPP HAM), trials were held before the Indonesian Ad Hoc Human Rights Court in Jakarta, Timor-Leste established the Commission of Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste (CAVR), and trials and investigations were conducted by the UN Special Panels for Serious Crimes and Serious Crimes Unit (SCU) in Dili. While all of these attempts were meaningful, Indonesia and Timor-Leste felt that they needed a bilateral truth mechanism to genuinely encourage reconciliation. Hence, both governments agreed to the Terms of Reference of the Commission of Truth and Friendship in December 2005. The CTF aimed to comprehensively review all the previous efforts at truth in order to establish a “conclusive truth” about the events leading up to and immediately following the Popular Consultation in East Timor in 1999 to promote reconciliation, non-recurrence, and institutional responsibility. It was not of a judicial nature and had no powers to compel, nor was it allowed to recommend prosecutions, although it was allowed to recommend amnesty. Interestingly, the CTF had no real legal basis. The ICTJ notes that “Despite initial plans for the Commission to be established formally by legislation in both Timor-Leste and Indonesia, this never occurred. Indeed, neither parliament ratified the [Terms of Reference]. It is likely that this put the CTF in violation of both countries’ constitutions.” During its operations, it took 119-147 testimonies, held 16 socialization meetings with community and government stakeholders, 14 discussions with experts, seminars on friendship and reconciliation, and 12 interactive TV and radio dialogues. However, the CTF has been criticized for how little it completed in 3 years with US $4 million, especially considering that the CAVR collected nearly 8,000 statements, conducted more than 1,000 interviews, held 60 public hearings, and convened 216 Community Reconciliation Procedure hearings in 2 years with US $6 million. This raised questions about the efficiency of time and resource use. In general, the CTF used its most productive period, the review of documentation, to critique previous mechanisms. The CTF was also criticized for its problematic public hearings, which did not occur under oath and thus allowed perpetrators to make self-serving and unsubstantiated accounts of the violence. This risked re-victimization and allowed whitewashing of Indonesian actions. Overall, civil society and NGOs (including the ICTJ) condemned elements of the CTF’s mandate as perpetuating impunity. However, the CTF’s report did surprise many of its critics by claiming that Indonesian security forces and civilian authorities committed crimes against humanity in East Timor. By endorsing the report’s findings, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono gave Indonesia’s first official recognition that its state institutions had systematically violated human rights in East Timor.

193,616,0,Truth and Dignity Commission,Instance Verité et Dignité (Truth and Dignity Commission),"When Tunisia gained its independence from France in 1956, Habib Bourguiba, a nationalist and independence leader, assumed the position of Prime Minister. A year later, the state converted into a Presidential Republic, when Bourguiba assumed the Presidency and his party, the Democratic Constitutional Rally (RCD), occupied a majority in the National Constituent Assembly. Bourguiba proclaimed himself President for life in 1975 and would occupy the Presidency until 1987, and until 2011, the state and the RCD (under different names) were essentially synonymous. Bourguiba severely repressed political opposition, notably in the 1978 Black Thursday protest massacre, which ushered in a period of political crisis during the 1980s. Bourguiba’s health was beginning to decline. To maintain his place in power, Bourguiba increased clientelism to the point that it seriously hampered social and economic development, exacerbated by a drop in oil prices. In 1983, an IMF loan conditionality package was introduced, causing the end of food subsidies and the price of bread to skyrocket. This prompted the Tunisian bread riots, which lasted for nearly a year during which time Bourguiba declared a state of emergency, calling out the military and leaving 150 people dead. Political instability continued, and in 1987, doctors declared Bourguiba unfit to rule. But change did not come to Tunisia; in a bloodless coup, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali assumed the presidency and instituted a regime much more obviously violent than Bourguiba’s. Ben Ali’s family orchestrated mass corruption, embezzling state funds and natural resources and masterminding a drug trafficking ring while imposing economic liberalization that impoverished marginalized communities. He committed human rights violations against the opposition and press, restricting freedom of speech and assembly while condoning arbitrary detentions and torture. In 2010, riots over unemployment and poor living conditions escalated, forcing Ben Ali to announce that he would not run for another presidency. On December 17, 2010, fruit vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire in the streets to protest the autocratic crimes of Ben Ali and the half-century long economic and social marginalization of the average Tunisian. This catalyzed the Jasmine Revolution, an intensive 3-month popular movement that forced Ben Ali to flee Tunisia and installed a democratic government led by the Ennadha movement. The revolution is often considered the beginning of the Arab Spring. On December 24, 2013, President Mohamed Moncef Marzouki promulgated Organic Law No. 2013-53 on Establishing and Organizing Transitional Justice, a National Constituent Assembly bill that created le Instance Verité et Dignité (Truth and Dignity Commission). It was composed of 15 commissioners appointed by a multisectoral and multiparty process in the National Constituent Assembly and was given four years to investigate a broad range of human rights violations committed since 1951. In 2014, the IVD and other government ministries signed a Partnership Agreement with UN agencies (UNDP, OHCHR), and the EU, Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands to help facilitate public hearings, outreach, and technical support. The IVD had the power to summon testimony and subpoena documents, regardless of those documents’ confidential status, enforceable by the courts and backed by penalties for non-compliance, interference, or obstruction including a maximum of 6 months imprisonment and a fine of 2,000 Dinars. Nonetheless, the IVD suffered extreme challenges. Although the President granted the IVD’s request to access the Presidential archives, the National Archives Director refused, bogusly alleging that he could not unilaterally make this decision, despite the fact that the National Archives are subordinate to the President, who had ordered the transfer. When the IVD invoked its power to hold the Director in non-compliance and asked the Court of First Instance to prosecute him, the Director organized a petition of “Patriotic Historians” condemning the IVD as a smear campaign that exploited victims. To this day, the Court has not prosecuted him. This, above other challenges faced by the IVD, negatively impacted its public reputation, and created around it a climate of scandal. Further challenges accessing archives—including the Ministry of Interior denying access to the political police records and the military justice system abstaining from the IVD—were exacerbated by a series of Presidential Bills that nullified or were inconsistent with the IVD’s mandate. These bills included full impunity for perpetrators of financial corruption and established a “reconciliation commission” that was not independent and that violated Tunisia’s responsibilities under multiple UN Conventions. The commissioners and staff were also targeted by administrative sanctions, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revoking their passports and failing to enact legislation to pay them. Also, according to its final report, the IVD “was the target of systematic campaigns of disinformation in which audiovisual and print media as well as online websites took part through a series of falsehoods and slanders.” The IVD also condemns the ICTJ’s attempts to “simmer internal conflicts” and “act as if [it] were a parallel [commission].” Nonetheless, the IVD completed significant work. Its final report, published on its website in 2019, documents 177,725 violations, 122,760 of which were violations of civil and political rights and 47,772 of which were violations of economic, social, and cultural rights. In total, the IVD received 62,720 complaints, only 57,593 of which were accepted, and 205 files from the National Anti-Corruption Commission. It took 49,654 testimonies and recorded 80,000 gigabytes of testimony from 14 public hearings. The IVD also conducted a massive outreach campaign, including banners on public buildings, televised and radio advertisements, and social media campaigns, resulting in 1.4 million viewers for the first public hearing session. It referred 69 indictments to the Public Prosecutor, including 1120 cases and 1426 accused perpetrators. The final report makes hundreds of recommendations, mostly relating to judicial independence, social and economic reforms as a way to guarantee non-recurrence, collective reparations including symbolic reparations like memorialization, addressing sexual violence and minority discrimination, anti-corruption measures including tax and real estate reform, and legal changes like decentralization to prevent regional political marginalization. other coder: The Tunisian Truth and Dignity Commission (l'Instance Vérité et Dignité (IVD)) was created following the 2011-2012 revolution which the report refers to as the Revolution of Liberty and Dignity, commonly known as the Arab Spring. Tunisia is the only country to establish a truth commission in the wake of the Arab Spring. IVD’s mandate was to examine human rights violations committed by the Tunisian government from July 1, 1955 to December 24, 2013 and “Draft recommendations and proposals related to the political, administrative, economic, security, judicial, media, educational and cultural reforms and the administration vetting and other recommendations and suggestions it deems appropriate to avoid the return to oppression and tyranny, to human rights violations and to misuse of public funds,” as well as measures aimed at promoting democracy and national reconciliation, among other things (Organic Law 53, Article 43). IVD defines violations broadly, investigating not only gross human rights violations like killing, rape, and torture, but also systematic violations like electoral rigging and police procedures. IVD connects the crimes of financial corruption and embezzlement of public funds to gross human rights violations, understanding the first set of crimes as enabling the second set. IVD is innovative in its understanding of victims, defining them as “individuals, groups of individuals, a legal entity or a region” (IVD Final Report, p 29) and allowing victims, broadly understood, to apply for reparations. It is the first TC to understand regions as victims. The broad aims of IVD are “achieving national reconciliation, drafting and documenting collective memorialization, establishing guarantees of non-recurrence of violation and transition from the state of totalitarianism to a democratic system consecrating the human rights system” (IVD Final Report, p 29). Throughout its operation, IVD faced obstruction from the government, including: state institutions denying IVD access to information, various government ministries refusing to cooperate with IVD; retaliation against IVD commissioners, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revoking their passports; and the People’s Representatives’ Assembly attempting to end IVD’s term on March 26, 2018 (see Volume I, Chapter 10 of the final report for more details). Despite, these obstacles, IVD completed its work. IVD was in operation from December 24, 2013 until December 31, 2018 and published its final report on March 26, 2019. The English language version of the final report is 644 pages and is available online.",domestic,domestic law,"The IVD was created on December 24, 2013 by the Tunisian National Constituent Assembly (NCA), the body elected to draft a new constitution for Tunisia after the fall of President Zine al Abidine Ben Ali.

141,255,0,Commission of Inquiry for the Overcoming of the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in the Process of German Unity,(Commission of Inquiry for the Overcoming of the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in the Process of German Unity) Die Enquete-Kommission Überwindung der Folgen der SED-Diktatur im Prozess der Deutschen Einheit,"After World War II, Germany was divided into four military zones. The three Western zones governed by the Allies while the Eastern zone became the German Democratic Republic. The GDR was ruled by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), which restricted political, economic, and personal freedoms to consolidate social control and enforce their Marxist-Leninist ideological project. Faced with growing civil unrest in 1989, SED leader Erich Honecker was forced to resign and East German citizens were allowed to enter West Germany. In 1990, Germany was reunited after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 1992, the German Parliament, the Bundestag, responded to popular demand for truth about and recognition of the SED dictatorship with a parliamentary committee, die Enquete-Kommission Aufarbeitung von Geschichte und Folgen der SED-Diktatur in Deutschland (Commission of Inquiry for Working Through the History and the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in Germany). While this truth commission was largely a success, its final report was criticized for being geared toward academic and research purposes rather than the general public, who were the ones campaigning for the COI in the first place. Its final report recommends a continuation of the investigation into the SED, which was fulfilled in 1995 by Act No. 13/1535 creating die Enquete-Kommission Überwindung der Folgen der SED-Diktatur im Prozess der Deutschen Einheit (Commission of Inquiry for the Overcoming of the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in the Process of German Unity). This COI was largely the same in powers, mandate, and organizational structure as the 1992 COI. It is notable that rather than 27 commissioners, there were 24, 13 of whom had served on the previous COI. While this COI investigated the same time period, it was geared less toward fact-finding and more toward a thematic analysis of the consequences and lasting impact of the SED dictatorship. To this end, it investigated education, science, and culture in the context of militarization of society and structural violence; economic, social, environmental policies in the context of a socialist planned economy; and a divided Germany in divided Europe and how this affected socioeconomic and political culture and persecution within the context of East vs. West relations. In 25 public hearings, the COI heard 292 testimonies from “contemporary witnesses” and historical experts. It submitted an interim report in 1997 and its 14-volume final report in June 1998 to the Bundestag. The final report was criticized for the same problems as the 1992 final report: excessive length and an academic/research focus rather than accessibility to the general public. However, it did come to some significant conclusions and recommendations which resulted in legislation. The COI’s report focused on everyday aspects of repression, such as blanket discrimination against women and the severe restrictions on consumption of goods. It found that the SED became increasingly more restrictive of social, cultural, political, educational, and scientific culture in an effort to solidify its social control even as it was facing increasing resistance from the German people. This contributed to psychosocial trauma, prompting the COI to recommend collective reparations to an expanded group of victims, including those who suffered psychological and other medical conditions as a result of their treatment by the SED. It also recommended memorialization efforts, many similar to the memorialization strategies proposed by the 1992 COI, including museums, documentation centers, national holidays, and mapping of government buildings used by the SED. Finally, it recommended a permanent body to propagate knowledge of human rights and administer programs providing for the victims of the SED dictatorship. In 2007, the Bundestag adopted a law furthering reparations for former political prisoners and other, unaddressed victims’ groups, such as students and those in poor health. Also, in June 2000, the Bundestag established a memorial at a former detention facility in Berlin-Hohenschönhausen. A foundation was established to investigate the history of the facility and inform the public about acts that took place there and their consequences. Finally, in 1998, the Bundestag established the Bundesstiftung Aufarbeitung, the Federal Foundation for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Eastern Germany, which is dedicated to working through the SED dictatorship and processing the victims of other political violence. Its mandate and mission can be reviewed on its website, https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/de/foundation. The Foundation has supported over 3,300 projects funded by almost 48 million euros dealing with communist dictatorships throughout Germany and internationally.

144,90,0,Commission for Historical Clarification,Commission for Historical Clarification (Comisión de Esclarecimiento Histórico),"The Commission for Historical Clarification (Comision para el Esclarecimiento Historico) in Guatemala was created to address the state repression against citizens in the mid-1950s through the 1970s by militia groups. In 1982, the Guatemalan army ""conducted a scorched earth campaign against the newly formed Revolutionary National Unity of Guatemala (URNG), resulting in a high number of deaths"" [USIP]. In 1987, the first government-URNG talks were held in Spain, but URNG continued to rebel in order to weaken the government. The parties continued the peace negotiations that were facilitated by the UN in 1993, which were successful and led to the establishment of this truth commission on June 23, 1994. It operated for a period of two years until February 1999. The truth commission's mandate was established to clarify past human rights abuses and violence acts concerning the 36-year internal conflict from 1960 to 1996 when the Accord for Firm and Lasting Peace agreement was signed, and to promote acceptance and preserve the victims' memories. The truth commission composed of three commissioners, two Guatemalan men and one woman of Maya descent. The chairman was Christian Tomuschat of Berlin's Humboldt University, who was appointed by the Secretary-General of the UN. ""The mandate stipulated that one member had to be a Guatemalan of irreproachable conduct, appointed by the chair with the agreement of the parties to the peace agreement. The other member had to be an academic selected by the moderator, with the agreement of the parties, from a list proposed by the University presidents"" (USIP). The truth commission report was presented as ""Guatemala: Memory of Silence"" or Guatemala: Memoria del Silencio, to the Guatemalan government and UN on February 25, 1999. The report is also available in English on the American Association for the Advancement of Science website. The report found: ""The commission found that repressive practices were perpetrated by institutions within the state, in particular the judiciary, and were not simply a response of the armed forces. The report stated that in the four regions most affected by the violence, â€œagents of the state committed acts of genocide against groups of Mayan people"" (Final Report, English Version, para. 122). In total, the Commission conducted 7,200 interviews with 11,000 persons cataloging the interviews in a database. Declassified information from the U.S. government was included in the data. The total number of people killed was over 200,000; 83% of the victims were Mayan and 17% were Ladino. ‘State forces and related paramilitary groups were responsible for 93% of the violations documented’ (Final Report, English Version, para. 15). ‘Insurgent actions produced 3% of the human rights violations and acts of violence’ (Final Report, English Version, para. 21). Social mobilization was at its peak from 1978 to 1982 and so too was the rate of killings and human rights abuses.”",domestic,peace agreement,,,United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights in and Guatemala. 1994. “Agreement on the Establishment of the Commission to Clarify Past Human Rights Violations and Acts of Violence That Have Caused the Guatemalan Population to Suffer.”,1994,1994-06-23,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/peace_agreements/guat_940623.pdf>,completed,0,1997,"Comisión de Esclarecimiento Histórico. 1999. _Guatemala, Memoria Del Silencio_.

174,451,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"After the death of Sierra Leone’s first post-independence Prime Minister in 1964, its politics were increasingly characterized by corruption, mismanagement, and violence, leading to a collapse in education and civil society that created a “youth crisis.” Disenfranchised youth formed the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and populist Saika Stevens won the elections, converting Sierra Leone to a one-party state with his patrimonial rule of his All People’s Congress Party (APC). During his 20-year regime, Sierra Leonean infrastructure and institutions collapsed; the justice system and Parliament were perverted as tools of oppression, executing opponents and distributing diamond-funded patronage to supporters. In 1985, Stevens passed the Presidency to Joseph Saidu Momoh, ainept leader who maintained the status quo until 1990, when he amended the constitution to allow multiparty elections. The RUF, led by Foday Sankoh, vehemently opposed multiparty politics and fought for control of the government—and control of the country’s diamond industry. In March 1991, the RUF attempted to overthrow Momoh’s government, taking control of the diamond-rich Eastern and Southern territories and formally initiating the Sierra Leonean Civil War. They recruited the more than 80,000 Liberian refugees seeking asylum in Sierra Leone from the First Liberian Civil War and were aided by both Libya’s Qaddafi and Liberia’s Charles Taylor, who notoriously enriched himself from the diamond trade that funded the war. The RUF was also known for its terror tactics of physical mutilations, rape, and the recruitment of child soldiers. Due to the disruption of the diamond trade and ineffective management, the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) couped Momoh in 1992. By March 1996 civilian rule was reinstated and a ceasefire was negotiated in November, but the disgruntled Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) overthrew the elected government. The RUF and AFRC coaligned, taking over the capital, Freetown. The resulting wave of disappearances, rape, torture, and killing prompted international involvement; the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group stepped in and overtook Freetown, and the UN orchestrated negotiations in 1999. The resulting Lomé Peace Agreement included nearly blanket amnesty as a component of DDR, which also embraced placing rebel commanders in government positions; Foday Sankoh became the Vice President and was allowed to retain control of diamond mines. Article XXVI of the Lomé Peace Agreement called for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission, achieving accountability through truth-seeking rather than criminal justice. President Ahman Tejan Kabbah enacted the Truth and Reconciliation Act in February 2000, which established a body with the power to conduct warrantless searches and seizures and summon and subpoena testimony and/or documentation at the penalty of criminal contempt of court or police enforcement. The TRC mandate simply called for the investigation of nonspecific abuses relating to the armed conflict, only naming sexual abuse and violations involving children. The TRC commissioners chose to expand the scope of inquiry, interpreting the mandate as an investigation of all violations of international human rights and humanitarian law—not only violations of CPR, but also of ESCR as well as some lesser-adjudicated rights like the rights to development and peace. The TRC’s 7 commissioners were appointed by the President after a complex multilateral and multilevel consultative selection process. The OHCHR, UNDP, UNAMSIL, and government of Sierra Leone entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to guarantee the TRC’s success. The government would essentially facilitate with logistics (cars, facilities) wherever possible, UNAMSIL would ensure the transportation of the TRC staff, the OHCHR would provide technical assistance and funding, and the UNDP in Freetown received and administered this funding to guarantee the financial integrity of the TRC. The Joint Implementation Committee monitored this agreement. In early 2002, the philosophy of the Lomé Agreement was altered when President Kabbah requested that the UN establish a special criminal tribunal irrespective of the near-total amnesty agreed upon in the Lomé Agreement. Accordingly, the TRC, inaugurated only two months after the Parliament had ratified the UN-Sierra Leone Special Court Agreement, was born under a cloud of confusion. Right off the bat, the TRC suffered from what its final report describes as an “administrative crisis.” Its interim secretariat, the government staff tasked with accommodating the TRC, suffered from poor management and permitted a public image to develop that the TRC lacked leadership and was unprepared for the challenges that lay ahead. Subsequently, the commissioners were polarized, and the international commissioners actually left—it took direct intervention from the OHCHR to restore international confidence. The TRC’s budget also suffered—the OHCHR had originally drafted a $9.9 million budget for the TRC, but donors lacking confidence talked the TRC down to $6.5 million, and then again to $4.1 million. In 2003, however, the TRC rebounded with the statement-taking process. It established 13 operational offices in regional districts, where 73 statement-takers took 7,706 testimonies. One statement-taker was even deployed to the Sierra Leonean refugee camps in Guinea. Investigation teams were tasked with corroborating testimony but faced considerable resistance from the Southern and Eastern districts, where the RUF movement began. Ultimately, after eliminating duplicates and testimonies that could not be corroborated because the subjects were anonymous or otherwise indisposed, the TRC documents 14, 995 victims who suffered a total of 40, 242 violations. Many of these were heard in greater depth at public hearings, held at the Head Office in Freetown as well as in the districts, where public attendance was over 100 people a day. Transcripts from the public hearings were published as a 1700-page Appendix to the final report. The Commission makes 603 findings, including that the war was caused by corruption; that the post-independence regimes are collectively responsible for the war but the RUF, AFRC, SLA, and CDF are directly responsible for instigating and committing human rights violations; that the RUF committed the most violations (60.5%); and that the majority of violations were forced displacement (19.8%), followed by abduction (14.8%), arbitrary detention (12%), and killing (11.2%). It also makes well over 500 recommendations, divided into three categories: imperative, work towards, and serious consideration. Comprehensively, they call for legal and constitutional reforms, judicial reforms, education, reparations, sexual violence and gender reforms, and corruption prevention. Although the mandate included the provision of a follow-up Committee to monitor the implementation of these recommendations, the largest criticism of the TRC is that these reforms were not implemented properly or at all. However, per the TRC’s recommendations, a National Human Rights Commission was established, and reparations legislation was passed.",hybrid,domestic law,President Dr. Ahmad Tejan Kabbah,,,2000,2000-02-22,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SeirraLeone-Charter.pdf>,completed,0,2002,,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,yes,1,1,1,Yes,"March 23, 1991 to July 7, 1999",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,14995,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/SeirraLeone-Charter.pdf>,fully independent,Yes,7,"The TRC Act states, “four of [the commissioners] shall be citizens of Sierra Leone and the rest shall be non-citizens, all of whom shall be appointed by the President after being selected and recommended in accordance with the procedure prescribed…” in the following.

181,732,0,Committee on Clearing Up Past Incidents for Truth and Reconciliation,진실화해를위한과거사정리위원회(Committee on Clearing Up Past Incidents for Truth and Reconciliation),"Korea has a complicated contemporary history fraught with external invasion and intervention and, internal violence, and war. Imperial Japan invaded Korea in 1910 after years of war, terror, and political manipulation. When Japan surrendered to the Allies in WWII, the 35-year Japanese occupation came to an end. The division at the 38th parallel marked Soviet-controlled North Korea and US-controlled South Korea. The United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGK) aimed to hold South Korean elections by 1948. However, many interest groups who had been active in the Korean independence movement opposed elections because they were uncomfortable with external forces permanently dividing the Korean Republic. These interest groups conducted mass demonstrations, resulting in police brutality, which ultimately fomented uprising, notably on Jeju Island. President Sygman Rhee was elected in 1948 and ordered the Southern Republic of Korea (ROK) forces to crush the uprising with support from the US Military and several right-wing citizen paramilitaries. Together, they committed mass atrocities on Jeju Island, Suncheon and Yeosu, massacring and burning villages. By the early 1950s, At the ROK had consolidated a monopoly on violence in the South, but the Northern Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) still claimed sovereignty over the South—reciprocally, the ROK also claimed sovereignty over the North. Effectively, both thought of Korea as a unified territory, but could not reach a negotiated settlement for unification. In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, precipitating the Korean War, widely agreed to have been a proxy war of the US-Soviet Cold War. When the DPRK forces first attacked, President Rhee mercilessly executed communist sympathizers and opposition forces. Both sides committed atrocities on civilian victims. After the 3-year war, Rhee continued repression with martial law and autocratic rule, leading to the April Revolution, a student movement that ended Rhee’s regime in 1960. A brief democratic government failed to consolidate power, and its purges of anti-democratic military and police led to a military coup led by Major General Park in 1961. In 1963, Park orchestrated and won elections. Initially, social and economic reforms increased the standard of living, winning Park a second term, but he made successive power grabs in the 70s, becoming an authoritarian ruler who violently repressed opposition, intellectuals, and religion through the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA). In 1979, mass demonstrations led to Park’s assassination, leading to another coup by Major General Chun. Chun generally continued the status quo of repression, notably in the Gwangju Massacre, but he retained some popularity with gradual social, economic, and political liberalization. In 1987, opposition parties gained enough political traction to force regime change, enacting a new constitution and democratic rule. The National Assembly passed Law No. 7542, The Framework Act on Clearing up Past Incidents for Truth and Reconciliation, on May 31, 2005, establishing the Committee on Clearing Up Past Incidents for Truth and Reconciliation. The TRC was intended to investigate most of Korea’s history; its temporal mandate was “since the Japanese occupation to the enforcement date of this Act” with a focus on “August 15, 1945 to the end of the authoritarian regimes.” It investigated both repeated crimes against Korean sovereignty by foreign and internal actors and state human rights violations. Due to the massive number of petitions and cases they were faced with, the commissioners decided in 2008 to only investigate deaths, disappearances, instances of arbitrary detention, displacement, and torture—noting, but no longer investigating, material damages. The TRC also had wide powers. It could summon and impose a fine for non-compliance with summons, and had full access to government files, although the relevant government institution could prevent publication of certain files. If a perpetrator freely made a confession prior to the TRC having knowledge of any criminal act committed by the perpetrator OR if a perpetrator cooperated with the TRC fully, both insofar as recounting his own acts as well as operating as an informant about other perpetrators and violations, then the TRC could recommend that person for immunity should they be criminally prosecuted. Clearly, this is not a direct exchange of amnesty for testimony, both because it is immunity, not amnesty, so only after criminal prosecution could the perpetrator be pardoned, and because the TRC could not grant the immunity— only the president can grant pardons. At the beginning of the TRC’s work, some 9,600 cases were before it. It received an additional 11,175 cases from 10,860 petitions, which were assigned by subject to their respective subcommittee, the Committee on the National Independence Movement, the Committee on Civilian Massacres, and the Committee on Human Rights Abuses. Only 8,450 cases were verified. The TRC established investigation teams in each region that partnered with local and provincial governments to take testimony and record victims counts. Between 2007-2009, investigation teams conducted 3,986 oral testimonies or group interviews in the investigation of 19,470 victims, 64 of which remain unconfirmed. For the clarification and cross-checking of this stage’s testimonies and victims counts, another investigation was launched in which local and provincial governments provided manpower and the TRC provided funding. During this stage in 2008 and 2009, the TRC identified 845,103 named and unnamed victims through group and informal interviews with 586,073 witnesses, families, descendants, and witness-adjacent people. This enabled the TRC to identify 168 clandestine burial sites, 66 of which where exhumation was possible. The TRC conducted exhumations in 2009, exhuming 1,617 bodies and 5,600 personal articles. The TRC entered into an agreement with the Chungbuk National University to create a Korean War Civilian Victims Memorial Hall to hold and archive the remains. The TRC made recommendations in 8,691 cases, 7,099 of which were related to civilian mass killings. In response the TRC’s recommendation for retrial in 42 cases in which the court had previously perpetrators, the Supreme Court granted 18 retrial and 16 petitions for retrial were pending at the time of the report. Unfortunately, in 10 of the cases granted retrial, the accused was again acquitted. Other recommendations, which were made in biannual reports submitted directly to the government and unavailable for public review, included “official state apologies, correction of the Family Registry, reexamination, memorial services, the correction of historical records, archiving of historical files, legislation for relief of damages, restoration of damages, peace and human rights education, indemnity of damages, and treatment of aftereffects.” Presidential Decree No. 20532 of January 2008 installed the Review Committee for the Execution of Recommendations on Past Affairs, which monitored the implementation of recommendations and agenda set recommendations in the National Assembly. In spite of the Review Committee, the main criticism of the TRC is that the implementation of recommendations has been slow and highly uneven. Easy recommendations like the correction of the Family Register have been performed, but financially burdensome recommendations like reparations remain untouched. Notably, in 2008 President Roh Mu-hyun apologized to the victims for the state’s illegal exercise of power and violence during the Korean War. The TRC was relaunched in December 2020 with an amendment to the Framework Act “to accommodate the urgent needs of survivors and victims’ families who have sought truth and justice for past state violence.” According to a speech from President Moon Jae-in, since the end of the TRC in 2010, new evidence has been revealed and sheds light on certain cases that were either not investigated or inconclusive by the first-round TRC, particularly about the Brothers Home internment camp in Busan. If all goes well, the second round of TRC work will end in 2023.

203,552,0,"Zimbabwe Commission of Inquiry into the Matabeleland Disturbances, aka the Chihambakwe Commission of Inquiry","Zimbabwe Commission of Inquiry into the Matabeleland Disturbances, aka the Chihambakwe Commission of Inquiry","For the first 37 years of its independence, Zimbabwe was under the iron-first rule of Robert Mugabe. Mugabe was a revolutionary hero, the leader of the Zimbabwean African National Union (ZANU) until 1980 and served also as the leader of its successor, the ZANU Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), until 2017. During British rule, when Zimbabwe was still Rhodesia, Mugabe was forced to flee to Mozambique after making anti-colonialism and anti-monarchy statements that angered the white minority. While in Mozambique, he established the ZANU and orchestrated its involvement in the Rhodesian Bush War, through which Rhodesia was granted independence in 1980. Mugabe and the ZANU easily won the 1980 elections, becoming Prime Minister and promoting socialist rhetoric, aligning Zimbabwe with China. He and other ZANU members ideologically conflicted with a paradoxically remarkably similar party, the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU), which had also been established under British rule and also supported socialism, but rather chose to align themselves with the USSR. The main difference was that ZANU supported race reconciliation and rural peasantry mobilization, while ZAPU supported Black nationalism and urban worker mobilization. ZAPU was largely made up of former guerillas, who were increasingly disgruntled with Mugabe and the ZANU and converted into dissidents, contributing to the Entumbane uprisings in 1981. The Army began to conduct raids on ZAPU’s stronghold of support in Matabeleland. However, due to the militant nature of ZAPU, they were met with armed resistance. In response, Mugabe made a deal with North Korean leader Kim II Sung, who promised to train a brigade to repress the ZAPU, known as the Fifth Brigade. In 1983 and 84, the Fifth Brigade committed atrocities against the people of Matabeleland and the Midlands, including massacring villages, in what has become known as the Gukurahundi. In hindsight, many political analysis and human rights organizations have called the Gukuranhundi an act of ethnic cleansing. The violence continued at a less intense pace until the Unity Accord of 1987, signed by Mugabe and ZAPU leader Joshua Nkoma, which effectively merged the ZANU and ZAPU into the ZANU-PF. The Commission of Inquiry Act was first enacted July 4, 1941 and was amended by Act 15/1981. It stipulated that the President may issue a proclamation to create a COI whenever he considers it advisable. Pursuant to this Act, President Mugabe proclaimed that a COI would be created in 1983 to investigate the Gukurahundi massacres, and the Zimbabwe Commission of Inquiry into the Matabeleland Disturbances began its work later that year. It had 4 commissioners and was chaired by Judge Simplisius Chihambakwe, the popular namesake of the COI. The Chihambakwe Commission was empowered by the COI Act to compel testimony and the production of documents under oath. Should any person or institution fail to comply with a summons or subpoena, the COI was empowered to hold them accountable for criminal contempt punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both. Although the commissioners included military and judicial representatives who could be considered complicit as employees of the state, various NGO and civil society reports do not allege that the Chihambakwe Commission lacked independence. In fact, they note that the commissioners risked their personal security by reporting on a broader range of abuses than was explicitly mandated and traveling into active conflict zones to take testimony through 1983. The COI also received written and oral testimonies that had been taken and documented by human rights groups such as the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, Amnesty International, and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. Medical records of those killed or injured during the violence were also examined, as well as skeletons found in mine shafts in the Midlands and a mass grave at in Matobo, which showed clear evidence of gunshot wounds. According to Richard Carver at Article 19, “people took enormous risks to testify before the commission.” This is demonstrated by the fact that several individuals who testified in front of the commission were later arrested and/or disappeared. The final report found that violence escalated quickly with the introduction of the Fifth Brigade, who used a more sophisticated strategy to intimidate civilians, including burning hut houses, cutting off food access, mass beatings, and executions. Unfortunately, however, the final report was never published. The official reason for this was because the conflict was ongoing and the information in the report could incite more violence. Mugabe was quoted saying that in the interests of “national unity,” he would not release the report. In 2000, two human rights groups, the Legal Resources Foundation and the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, filed suit in the High Court seeking an order compelling Mugabe to make public the two reports. Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was an architect of the massacres with Presidential aspirations, informed the High Court that the reports could no longer be located, alleging that it had been lost. In 2019, after Mnangagwa became President, a new National Peace and Reconciliation Commission attempted to access Chihambakwe’s report but was again rejected and informed that the report had been lost. While the ‘official’ numbers of the Chihambakwe report are unavailable, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, from which the Chihambakwe Commission received documents and testimony, has confirmed over 2,000 deaths, 680 house burnings, at least 10,000 detained, and at least 7,000 tortured and/or wounded. It further estimates that the death toll is closer to 3,000 or 4,000. Amnesty International claims that a leaked copy of the report estimates more than 3,000 extrajudicial executions, hundreds of disappearances, more than 7,000 beatings or cases of torture and more than 10,000 arbitrary detentions.

It is responsible for 3 main tasks: providing for public access to political archival records, removing authoritarian symbols and preserving sites where injustices occurred, and redressing judicial wrongs, restoring historical truth, and promoting social reconciliation. The Commission had the authority to recover and classify political archives, remove and eliminate authoritarian symbols, correct judicial wrongs, and promote social reconciliation (Lee and Chang).

208,165,0,Commission for Peace,Comisión para la Paz,"IIn 1973, the Uruguayan military superseded the elected Congress and its leaders were given sweeping authority to eliminate leftist opponents. Human rights abuses and repression ensued. The military leadership took part in Plan Condór, an orchestrated network among the military leaders of the Latin America's southern cone to suppress the leftist movement. Little was know about the extent of the violations in Uruguay during this period because of total military control. Most activists were either completely suppressed or fled the country. By 1984, political pressure for elections prevailed, and Julio Maria Sanguinetti was elected president in 1985. The Commission for Peace (Comisión para la Paz) was created with the aim of inquiring into the fate of the forced disappearances that occurred under the military dictatorship in Uruguay between 1973 and 1985 in accordance with the 1986 Amnesty Law, which mandated the government to investigate into about 200 disappearances. This truth commission was established in response to a lack of official response from the government to two former truth commissions: The Commission for the Investigation of the Situation of the Disappeared and Related Events and the Investigating Commission on the Kidnapping and Assassination of National Representatives Zelmar Michelini and Hector Gutierrez Ruiz released its findings. The commission operated for a period of two years from August 2000 to August 2002. The commission composed of six male members and presided by Archbishop Nicolas Cotungo. The final report entitled, Informe Final de la Comision para la Paz, was published on April 10, 2003 in Spanish. It found that information on the fates of 38 disappearances, comprising of 32 Uruguayans and 6 Argentineans. It reported that a majority of the crimes committed involved state officials. In a vast number of cases, the people who disappeared were held and torture in unofficial facilities. Many victims were secretly detained, tortured, and executed in Argentina, while other victims were held in Chile, Paraguay, Brazil, Colombia, and Bolivia. The report also identified cases of extra-judicial executions. ""The vast majority of victims did not participate in subversive organizations nor did they engage in militant groups. The date of their deaths indicates that a majority of victims was killed after the sedition was already broken."" Following the recommendations, the government adopted the conclusions of the report and created an agency to continue the work of the commission. The army did not recognize its role in the crimes committed and 14 Generals publically denounced the report's findings. In 2006, Juan Maria Bordaberry, the former President was arrested because of his involvement in the deaths of political opposition members in 1976.

The commission was to investigate crimes of terrorism and human rights violations committed by all parties between 1980 and 2000. Shining Path, a Maoist opposition group, began to rise up against Peru's military government in 1980 in protest of the social and economic inequality in Peru (USIP). Two years later, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, took up arms against the government and Shining Path as well. Shining Path's leader Abimael Guzmán, along with other key leaders in the group, were captured in 1992 causing the group to lessen activity. The government ceased conflict engagement when President Alberto Fujimori was forced from office and government control was given to Valentin Paniagua who was to act as caretaker. During the time of conflict, disappearances, deaths, and terrorist acts took place by all groups. The Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación, CVR was appointed 12 Peruvian commissioners (10 men, 2 women) to investigate the acts of violence and terrorism by all three groups (Peruvian government, Shining Path, and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement) involved in the conflicts between 1980 and 2000. Salomon Lerner Febres chaired the commission whose members were appointed by the President and approved by Council of Ministers. The final report, Informe Final de la Comision de la Verdad y Reconciliacion (The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission) was released on August 28, 2003 to President Alejandro Toledo and ""other members of government"" (USID, http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-peru-01). Findings: 1. Based on statistical analysis, the CVR's final report estimated that the total number of people who died during the conflict period is between 61,007 and 77,552, in addition to hundreds of thousands of displaced persons. 2. The Shining Path was the principal perpetrator of crimes and human rights violations, responsible for 54% of the deaths. 3. The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement was responsible for 1.5% of the deaths. 4. The State, military, police, other security forces, political parties, and each of the governments in power during the conflict, most notably the administration of Alberto Fujimori are responsible the remaining deaths. 5. The legislature, judiciary, civil society, media, and the educational system were co-opted in the perpetuation of violence and violent ideology.",domestic,domestic law,Government of Peru,,"\- Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación. 2003. “Comisión de La Verdad y Reconciliación: Informe Final.” Truth Commission Final Report.

160,70,0,"Commission for Access to the Truth, Historical Clarification, and the Promotion of Justice","Comisión para Aceso a la Verdad, la Esclarecimiento Histórico, y el Impulso de la Justicia (Commission for Access to the Truth, Historical Clarification, and the Promotion of Justice)","After the Mexican Revolution, factions of revolutionaries controlling territory vied for power, ultimately resulting in a coalition of regional caudillos, labor, and peasant leaders who sought stability. This consolidation of power was enshrined in the Partido Revolucionario Nacional, later renamed the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), which ruled uninterrupted for 71 years. During this time, the Mexican executive was highly concentrated and issued patronage (land, money, shares in nationalized industries, generally the means of production) to regional executives in return for political support. Regional executives imparted some of this patronage to their localities through peasant leaders and labor unions, but by the time patronage had been handed down the complex system, individual peasants and laborers at the bottom received almost nothing. Regardless, this system worked for a very long time, with each Chief Executive selecting his successor. During the 60s, 70s, and 80s, however, political demands for change increased, spurring student protests, the rise of Communist and Marxist parties, guerilla warfare, and peasant and labor disenchantment with the PRI. In an attempt to remain in its consolidated power, the PRI conducted mass violence against political opposition, including massacres, raids, counter-guerilla initiatives, arbitrary detention, restrictions on freedom of expression, and kidnapping, and forced disappearance. This period from 1965-1990 is generally referred to as la Guerra Sucia, the Dirty War. The legalization of left-wing parties and amnesty for imprisoned guerillas in 1978 slowed hostilities, but state systematic violence continued until the end of the PRI dictatorship in 2000, with the election of Vincente Fox. President Fox established the Special Prosecutor's Office for Social and Political Movements of the Past (FEMOSPP), but due to a lack of political will, funding, and an unreceptive judiciary, no prosecutions have been achieved. The 2018 election of Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), the most left President Mexico has seen, rang in hope that there would be new attempts at truth. In the same year, AMLO decreed the creation of the Comisión para la Verdad y Acceso a la Justicia en el Caso Ayotzinapa (Commission for the Truth and Access to Justice in the Ayotzinapa Case) to investigate the disappearance of 43 students in Guerrero in 2014. This prefaced the creation of the Comisión para Aceso a la Verdad, la Esclarecimiento Histórico, y el Impulso de la Justicia (Commission for Access to the Truth, Historical Clarification, and the Promotion of Justice) to investigate human rights abuses during the 1965-1990 Dirty War, which is not technically classified as a civil conflict by UCPD. As such, it is neither a post-conflict TC, but it is technically post-autocratic. The Commission was created by Presidential Decree October 6, 2021. According to this Decree, the Commission must submit its report by September 2024. It works through five instruments: a Historical Clarification Mechanism, headed by a group of independent experts; a Committee for the Promotion of Justice; a Special Search Program; a Special Reparation and Compensation Program; and the construction of a National Memory Center for Human Rights, as well as the promotion of a Memory Law. Its composition is very unusual; it is made up of 5 expert commissioners and 6 government representatives who…oversee? Contribute? This is unclear, but the multi-stakeholder makeup of the commission may be intended to facilitate inter-ministerial and intra-government cooperation with the Commission, which suffers from very slim powers. While it is clear that the Commission cannot compel testimony, there is some contradiction in whether it will be able to compel access to official government documents. Although the mandate is rife with references to government cooperation and coordination, recommending that the Commission establish collaboration mechanisms with multilevel legislative and judicial powers, it also specifies that the Commission is only able to make requests, not demands, of Public Administrations for relevant documents. Conversely, in a speech, AMLO announced that the Commission will have access to the archives of all federal government agencies without obstacles or impunity for any administration or individual. He has also been known to advocate for the transparency of government confidential documents—in 2019, he released previously confidential files from the secret police-intelligence service the Federal Security Directorate. Hopefully this is the case, because without the power to review unseen confidential documents, one may ask how the Commission will be able to investigate state party complicity in disappearances without perpetuating impunity. The Commission was formally initiated in October 2021 and began its inquires first into the facilities of the military camp A1. In this inquiry, media reports that it has been reviewing the Ministry of National Defense files. Again, it is unclear whether this is consensual or not. It will likely remain unclear exactly whether the Commission has unbridled access to all files or is at the will of Administrations’ selection of files until the Final Report is released. That being said, many victims groups and victims themselves have voiced confidence in the Commission. It has met with victims and victims groups several times into 2022. Some sources feel that the deterioration of the human rights situation under AMLO and his failure to stay true to some campaign promises do not bode well for the Commission’s success.",domestic,domestic law,Andrés Manuel López Obrador,,,2021,2021-10-06,<https://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5631865&fecha=06/10/2021>,ongoing,0,2021,"<https://www.infobae.com/america/mexico/2022/06/22/inician-trabajos-de-la-comision-para-el-acceso-a-la-verdad-que-la-principal-reparacion-a-las-victimas-sea-la-justicia/#:~:text=Con%20una%20ceremonia%20simb%C3%B3lica%2C%20dieron,presidencial%20en%20octubre%20de%202021>",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,no,don't know,1,1,1,Yes,1965 to 1990,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,,<https://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5631865&fecha=06/10/2021>,partially independent,Yes,13,"The representative of state ministries were named according to their positions in the mandate, and the experts were stipulated to be “of recognized moral quality or professional prestige… proposed jointly by a representative of the Undersecretary for Human Rights, Population and Migration, a representative of the victims, their families and the survivors , with the technical advice of the Office in Mexico of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.” The President of the Commission would select and appoint the experts based on the proposals from these stakeholders.",No,Unknown,,,<https://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5631865&fecha=06/10/2021>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5631865&fecha=06/10/2021>,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,No,<https://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5631865&fecha=06/10/2021>,"“DOF - Diario Oficial de La Federación.” Accessed March 23, 2022. https://www.dof.gob.mx/busqueda_detalle.php.

50,840,0,Presidential Committee on Human Rights,Presidential Committee on Human Rights,"""A truth commission was set up in the Philippines by the Corazon Aquino government shortly after it took power in 1986. The ""Presidential Committee on Human Rights"" was given the mandate to investigate both past and present abuses, covering acts that had taken place since 1972, the beginning of martial law in the Philippines. President Aquino appointed a highly respected Filipino lawyer to serve as the chairman, Senator Jose W. Diokno. Senator Diokno crafted the specific mandate of the committee, which limited its investigation to abuses committed by ""government officers or their agents, or by persons acting in their stead or under their orders."" This limitation was established in the belief that violence perpetrated by the guerrilla forces constituted common crimes and could be dealt with directly in the courts.""

In 2017, the CHR came under fire from President Duterte, who said it would not be allowed to investigate his men, and might better be abolished. The CHR reminded Duterte that under the 1987 Constitution, the commission is mandated to investigate all forms of human rights violations involving civil and political rights in the country.

124,483,0,"The Commission of Inquiry into the Crimes and Misappropriations Committed by Ex-President Habré, His Accomplices and/or Accessories","Commission d'Enquête du Ministère Chadien de la Justice sur les Crimes du Régime de Hissène Habré (The Commission of Inquiry into the Crimes and Misappropriations Committed by Ex-President Habré, His Accomplices and/or Accessories)","After the end of Chad's civil war in 1979, fighting between President Oueddei’s forces and Defense Minister Hisséne Habré’s forces resulted in an end to the short-lived government of national unity. Habré gained power by assassination, torture, detentions, and disappearances to repress any opposition. Once in power, he maintained an extensive network of clientelism amongst his Gorane tribe via narcotrafficking. By placing members of his Gorane tribe in high political positions, paying off existing political allies, and eradicating opposition, Habré retained power from 1982-90. French, Zairian, and Libyan forces attempted to oust Habré but were unsuccessful due to the prevalence of his clientelist network and forces, including his notorious private political police, the DDS, which conducted mass killings and protection rackets in marginalized territories. In 1989, one of Habré's generals, Idriss Déby, fled to Sudan and formed the Patriotic Salvation Movement with the intention of overthrowing Habré. With the help of Libya and Sudan, Déby infiltrated Habré’s government and marched unopposed into N’Djamena in 1990. As Habré fled, he is said to have taken the contents of Chad's treasury and killed all political prisoners. On December 29, 1990, in the midst of forming his new government, Déby promulgated Decree No. 014/P.CE/CJ/90, which established the Commission of Inquiry into the Crimes and Misappropriations Committed by Ex-President Habré, His Accomplices and/or Accessories. It was granted a very narrow fact-finding mission with very little power. Given the scale of Déby’s own human rights violations and his apparent leniency with former members of Habré’s regime, it was obvious that the COI was a strategy for legitimization of what would become Déby’s own authoritarian regime. In spite of this, however, the COI conducted remarkably high quality and independent work. It began its work in 1991 but was paralyzed by a lack of physical resources and ongoing violence. Ironically, it was placed in the former DDS headquarters. This stimulated witnesses’ trauma, thus impacting the quality of their testimony and preventing others from testifying at all. Additionally, the reemployment of former Habré loyalists in high government positions led to witnesses and victims questioning the intentions of the COI, fearing that their testimony may be used against them by the current regime or if Habré returned to power. Further, those reemployed government officials felt that they deserved and had achieved impunity, and thus refused to testify or were condescending toward the COI in their testimony. This sentiment infiltrated the COI, with several commissioners failing to adequately perform the COI’s mandate for fear that former Habré officials would use their work against them. The final report claims that several commissioners disappeared from work and only showed up at the end of the month to pick up their pay. This led to Decree No. 382/PR/MJ/91 of July 29, 1991, which extended the COI’s report deadline by 4 months, replaced ¾ of the COI’s commissioners, and clarified the COI’s mandate as twofold, identifying a criminal component and a financial component. Despite this advancement, methodological impediments, specifically the fear that Habré would return and use witnesses’ testimonies against them, were only amplified by the armed attacks at Lake Chad in late 1991 that sought to return Habré to N’Djamena. The COI did manage to conduct a considerable investigation, however. It took 1,726 testimonies of victims and perpetrators, exhumed 3 mass graves, discovered and preserved execution chambers across the country, and determined that Habré embezzled one billion francs annually from public funds. The COI acknowledged that its work only covers 10% of the crimes of Habré due to time, financial, and resource restraints, implying in its final report that the Déby administration had no real interest in historical truth. Within this 10%, the COI estimated 40,000 detainee deaths, 80,000 orphans, 30,000 widows, and 200,000 people left without “moral or material” support. With this information, the COI concludes that Habré conducted and promulgated a genocide of Chadian people. In its final report, the COI underlines non-recurrence; Habré’s violence and impact on the Chadian population should serve as a lesson to all Chadians. It makes 14 recommendations to this effect, including prosecuting Habré and DDS agents, removing former Habré loyalists and DDS agents from high government positions, establishing an independent National Human Rights Council, returning the property confiscated by Habré’s regime to the former owners, and memorialization efforts, including converting the DDS headquarters into a museum and erecting of a monument to remember victims. The COI also recommends establishing an independent judiciary and a “real democracy,” again taking a stab at President Déby’s legitimacy. The COI’s recommendations were almost entirely ignored by President Déby. However, a National Human Rights Council was established in 1994, and several prosecutions occurred. Beginning in 2000, victims began taking legal action against Habré, who had fled to Senegal. In 2006, the UN ruled that the Senegalese Courts had violated the Convention against Torture by not prosecuting Habré and the AU reiterates a demand for prosecution. This was reiterated by ECOWAS in 2010 and by the ICJ in 2012, finally resulting in the Extraordinary African Chambers in the Senegalese Court, which were specifically convened to hear Habré’s case. The EAC also unsuccessfully attempted to extradite other members of Habré’s regimes.

199,551,0,Special International Commission on the Assassination of Herbert Chitepo (the Chitepo Commission),Special International Commission on the Assassination of Herbert Chitepo (the Chitepo Commission),"The struggle for independence in Zimbabwe, at the time Rhodesia, was very intertwined with other nations, particularly South Africa, Zambia, and Mozambique. The Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU) was a nationalist party banned by the British in Rhodesia for its militancy. In reaction to the banning, many nationalist ZAPU members fled. Many, including Herbert Chitepo and Robert Mugabe (who would go on to rule Zimbabwe for 37 years after its independence), fled to Mozambique, which was actively embroiled in the Mozambique War of Independence. Zimbabwean nationalists with militant connections from ZAPU established the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), a nationalist political party-militant group to regroup the Zimbabwean nationalist movement and direct military aid to the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). Herbert Chitepo, who had fled to Mozambique and then Tanzania, where he served as the first African Director of Public Prosecutions, was appointed the National Chairman of ZANU. After the Lusaka Accord, in which the Portuguese government acknowledged the independence of Mozambique and made peace plans with FRELIMO, Chitepo moved ZANU to Lusaka, Zambia. From Zambia, ZANU began making military incursions into Rhodesia, beginning the Rhodesian Bush War. However, ZANU had very complex internal politics, particularly between moderates and radicals, who could largely be delimitated by ethnicity. The Karanga and Manyika elements internal to ZANU continuously pushed for competing strategies and ideologies, leading to the establishment of the Zimbabwe Revolutionary Council—the Dare—to discuss settle various internal disputes. Ultimately, as allegations spread about Manyika Chitepo’s willingness to remain moderate and accept détente, Chitepo was assassinated by car bomb on 18 March 1975. The circumstances of and responsibility for his death remain uncertain. Although this occurred amidst Zimbabwean nationals and under the banner of a group claiming Zimbabwean sovereignty, it occurred on Zambian territory. Eager to clear Zambia’s name in the assassination, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda established the Special International Commission on the Assassination of Wiltshire Chitepo (the Chitepo Commission) in July 1975 to investigate Chitepo’s death. Since the mandate of the Commission is unavailable, little is known about its organizational structure. It was chaired by Reuben Kamanga, a member of Zambia’s ruling party (UNIP), and there were commissioners from Libya, Madagascar, Morocco, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Tanzania, and Zaire. It could compel testimony and support prosecutions, and received written and oral testimonies from victims and alleged perpetrators, many of whom were imprisoned in Lusaka. It released its report in March 1976, finding that Chitepo had been killed by a Rhodesian agent and was a victim of the “mutual hatred and suspicion among the tribal groups” within ZANU. It noted that Chitepo's death was the climax of a struggle for power, and that “the victorious Karanga, now supreme in the party's command, had eliminated the Manyika Chitepo.” In particular, the report claimed that the Dare had plotted Chitepo’s death and that Joseph Tongogara had committed the crime. The main criticism of the Commission comes directly from its key witnesses, the 57 ZANU Dare members imprisoned in Lusaka and the 1,300 ZANU cadres detained at camps in Zambia. Many of these imprisoned deponents wrote responses to the Commission after the publication of its report, condemning its methodology and results. They claimed that the Commission was highly prejudiced against them, selectively admitting evidence only from those interest groups who were anti-ZANU, many of whom had called for Zambia to hang the imprisoned ZANU members. Since the commissioners were francophone and the Commission could not afford to employ professional translators, much of Shona-speaking testimony was translated by a volunteer ZAPU member, whose loyalty to ZAPU could have dramatically influenced the accuracy of the testimony and the overall impartiality of the Commission. Imprisoned ZANU members were also denied due process rights, without any power to cross-examine witnesses or call witnesses in their defense and were not informed of the so-called “verdicts” against them, so many were pronounced “guilty” without having ever appeared before the Commission. Even these verdicts were apparently unconstitutional given that the Commission was ostensibly a non-judicial body without the strict standard of proof or due process guarantees of a court. Some lawyers contracted by the ZANU members were also threatened or harassed by state agents to give up their representation. Worst of all, there is significant evidence that nearly all of the “confessions” and testimony heard by the Commission were forged or obtained under duress from torture or threats of violence. Those formally accused of killing Chitepo were never tried because the Zambian Courts pronounced the evidence procured by the Commission inadmissible due to the mounting proof of torture. Amnesty International released several statements condemning the methods of the Commission, and raising concern for the treatment of the ZANU members going forward. Diana Taylor points out that “the overall impact of the testimony is a catalogue of events, evils, and ills, an exercise in show and tell,” rather than in a genuine expression of truth-seeking. Other criticisms of the Commission come from scholars, who also condemn its lack of independence and question the positive impact of the report. Scholars claim that the Commission treated ethnic politics simplistically and cast the complex ZANU internal politics only in terms of clashing ethnicities and desire for power, diminishing the genuine ideological differences between ZANU factions. Others point out that the Commission exacerbated speculation about the ZANU internal power struggles, leading to even greater factionalism within ZANU and ZAPU as powerful stakeholders exploited its most inflammatory conclusions, such as those about ethnicity incompatibility, for political currency. Luise White claims that this part of the Commission’s impact is still present in Zimbabwean politics today—because the Commission confirmed conjecture rooting ethnic factionalism within the nationalism movement, ethnic factionalism became a “founding myth” intrinsic to the Zimbabwean national identity. Overall, the Commission was a political and diplomatic tool to paint Zambia as a mediator “friend” of the emerging nation. As such, it was insufficient and unthorough, resulting ultimately in the more robust African National Congress investigation into Chitepo’s death. As Luise White states, “Terms like “performance” and “scripting” and “staging” are excellent ways to think about a commission convened in Lusaka to exonerate Zambia from blame for Chitepo’s murder, or about detainees’ confessions which they insisted were written for them by their Zambian jailors.”",hybrid,domestic law,President Kenneth Kaunda,,,1975,1975-07-01,,completed,0,1975,<https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft158004rs&doc.view=content&chunk.id=d0e2944&toc.depth=1&anchor.id=0&brand=ucpress?Item=E000619> <https://www.pindula.co.zw/Herbert_Chitepo#cite_note-14>,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,No,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,<https://sr.b-ok.cc/book/886217/e319a0?dsource=recommend> <https://www.pindula.co.zw/Herbert_Chitepo#cite_note-14>,not independent,Yes,9,Appointed by President Kaunda,No,Unknown,,,<https://books.google.nl/books?id=QYHCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=chitepo+commission&source=bl&ots=NORu-nw-A6&sig=ACfU3U1wfzWVrwi3u1zzl7iCx8MezxXDfQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwianb3s5Jj6AhUFwAIHHUIUCNcQ6AF6BAgyEAM#v=onepage&q=chitepo%20commission&f=false> <https://sr.b-ok.cc/book/886217/e319a0?dsource=recommend> <https://www.pindula.co.zw/Herbert_Chitepo#cite_note-14>,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Yes,,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,https://sr.b-ok.cc/book/886217/e319a0?dsource=recommend,1976,Yes,"The Government of Zambia Printer published the report as a limited edition book, contained in only a few libraries around the world.",No,,,,No,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,<https://www.worldcat.org/title/report-of-the-special-international-commission-the-assassination-of-herbert-wiltshire-chitepo/oclc/42992424> <https://books.google.nl/books?id=QYHCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=chitepo+commission&source=bl&ots=NORu-nw-A6&sig=ACfU3U1wfzWVrwi3u1zzl7iCx8MezxXDfQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwianb3s5Jj6AhUFwAIHHUIUCNcQ6AF6BAgyEAM#v=onepage&q=chitepo%20commission&f=false> <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3556827.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ab64a9e5cd9688c3a2ba1f829272f50a0&ab_segments=&origin=&acceptTC=1>,No,,"Carver, Richard. “Who Wants to Forget?”: Truth and Access to Information about Past Human Rights Violations.

153,660,0,Commission of Investigation into the Fate of the Abducted and Disappeared Persons,Commission of Investigation into the Fate of the Abducted and Disappeared Persons,"Lebanon is home to a significant number of ethnoreligious groups. Despite the presence of Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, and Druze, Christians were favored in politics due to the presence of a strong pro-Western Christian political elite reinforced by the French Mandate (1920-43). Many Muslims grew discontented with their lack of political representation and contributed to the growth of pan-Arabism, promoting left-wing politics in Lebanon. The influx of thousands of Palestinians after World War II constituted a demographic shift in favor of the Muslim population, and as Cold War politics took hold, Lebanon became polarized. Muslim populations increasingly supported the Soviets while the Christian political majority remained aligned with the West. In 1975, the nationalist Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) began fighting with Christian militias, prompting a rapid militarization of each political interest group, including pan-Arabist left-wing Lebanese National Movement (LNM). This signaled the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War. By 1976, Syria had intervened in support of the PLO, attempting to serve its own political and territorial interests, including rooting out Sunni cells and the anti-Ba’athist Muslim Brotherhood. The Arab League granted Syria permission to maintain its troops in Lebanon as an Arab Deterrent Force (ADF). In 1977, the ADF and Christian militia engaged in the Hundred Days War, after which the ADF was ordered to leave Lebanon. Lebanese forces increasingly attacked Israeli territory, prompting Israeli and US involvement in favor of the Christian majority. Paramilitary forces, political groups, split off factions, and foreign alliances shifted rapidly. In 1982, the US and UN stationed the Multinational Force in Lebanon to oversee the withdrawal of PLO and Syrian troops, but later that year, Iran got involved in the war, financing the creation of Hezbollah. Fighting did not ebb until the signing of the Tarif Agreement in 1989, even after which it continued in East Beirut. The US unfairly brokered tensions between Israel, Syria, and Lebanon, driven by its own alliances and interests in the Gulf War to act preferentially toward Israel and Syria. Overall, during the civil war, 17,415 Lebanese disappeared or were abducted by the various militant groups. According to Amnesty International, the Lebanese officials have ""generally failed to protect mass graves and to conduct exhumations from the civil war period.” In 1991, Lebanon enacted Law No. 84, which imposed blanket amnesty on political crimes during the civil war. The families of the disappeared nonetheless were very active in demanding investigations into their relatives. The Committee of the Families of the Kidnapped and Disappeared in Lebanon (CFKDL) conducted advocacy demanding that the government locate the bodies or at least acknowledge the disappeared. It organized sit-ins, protests, outreach to international human rights organizations, lobbying, and public awareness campaigns that can largely be credited for forcing the Lebanese government to acknowledge the disappeared. In January 2000, civil society and the families’ efforts paid off with the establishment of the Official Commission of Investigation into the Fate of the Abducted and Disappeared Persons to investigate and “resolve” the disappearances, but this COI was largely a failure. It lacked independence; it was entirely composed of military and intelligence officers. Although it received 2,046 applications from families of the disappeared, it did not investigate any of these individually, and failed to take testimony from any of the families—instead only offering perpetrators implicated in the disappearances the opportunity to testify. Its report was never released. Due to the failure of the 2000 COI, the advocacy movement continued to demand a genuine investigation into the whereabouts of the disappeared. In 2001, the new Prime Minister Rafik Hariri obliged, reviving the COI under an “alternative” mandate. The (Alternative) Commission of Investigation into the Fate of the Abducted and Disappeared Persons was established by Decree No. 1/2001 on 5 January 2001. Its mandate was renewed twice, and it worked for 18 months in total. Like the 2000 COI, it investigated disappearances from 1975-1999, but its mandate was even less substantive than its predecessor. Instead of investigating all disappearances, it could only inquire into those disappeared “about whom there was reason to believe they were still alive.” The burden of proof demonstrating that the disappeared person could conceivably still be alive was thus incumbent on the families. Further, the 2001 COI was basically powerless. According to its Chair, “the Commission merely collected the testimonies of the families and submitted requests to the ICRC for the missing in Israel, and to the Syrian authorities for the missing in Syria.” It could only conduct inquiry insofar as official government bodies were willing to comply; it had no powers to compel testimony or access to official documents. The only positive change made between the 2000 and 2001 COI was increased independence from the Lebanese state. 4 out of 7 commissioners were security officials, 2 were public officials, and one was a civilian commissioner—a representative of the Beirut Bar Association. Although an improvement, security forces officials retained a majority in the COI, and state officials – whether security forces or public administrators—made up more than a supermajority in the COI. So, the COI remained biased in favor of the state. It received 780 inquiry requests from the families and investigated into about 900 cases. It retained the “most serious cases” for further study, establishing a list of 97 disappeared persons that could still be alive. However, Lebanese authorities did not undertake any action to locate these disappeared persons or demand information about them from Syrian or Israeli authorities. None of the COI’s work product has been released to the public, in spite of the fact that it has been ordered by a Lebanese court. In 2009, the Committee of the Families of the Kidnapped and Disappeared in Lebanon (CFKDL) and Support of Lebanese in Detention and Exile (SOLIDE) petitioned the the Juge des Référés (Judge of Summary Procedures of Beirut) to grant a preliminary order requiring the release of the report (as well as the unreleased report of the prior “Official” Commission of 2000) in anticipation for the case’s hearing. The Court granted this order, mandating that the Council of Ministers hand over the reports to the Court, and ultimately to the families of the disappeared. The Council of Ministers refused to comply.",domestic,domestic law,Prime Minister Rafik Hariri,,[https://web.archive.org/web/20160321014751/http://www.justiceinperspective.org.za/middle-east/lebanon/alternative-commission-of-investigation-into-the-fate-of-the-abducted-and-disappeared-persons.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20160321014751/http:/www.justiceinperspective.org.za/middle-east/lebanon/alternative-commission-of-investigation-into-the-fate-of-the-abducted-and-disappeared-persons.html),2001,2001-01-05,,completed,0,2001,[https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http://www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance\_EN%202008.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http:/www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance_EN%202008.pdf) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160321014751/http://www.justiceinperspective.org.za/middle-east/lebanon/alternative-commission-of-investigation-into-the-fate-of-the-abducted-and-disappeared-persons.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20160321014751/http:/www.justiceinperspective.org.za/middle-east/lebanon/alternative-commission-of-investigation-into-the-fate-of-the-abducted-and-disappeared-persons.html),0,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,1975-1999,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,17415,<https://www.counterpart.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Case-Study-5_Committee-of-the-Families-of-the-Kidnapped-and-Disappeared.pdf> [https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http://www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance\_EN%202008.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http:/www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance_EN%202008.pdf),not independent,Yes,7,Appointed by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in consultation with the Council of Ministers,No,Unknown,,,[https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http://www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance\_EN%202008.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http:/www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance_EN%202008.pdf) [https://web.archive.org/web/20121204152740/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE18/001/2011/en/4c0716c2-8825-41d6-b816-c678ef4eeb44/mde180012011en.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20121204152740/http:/www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE18/001/2011/en/4c0716c2-8825-41d6-b816-c678ef4eeb44/mde180012011en.pdf),1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,[https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http://www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance\_EN%202008.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http:/www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance_EN%202008.pdf),No,,No,No,No,No,,,https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http://www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance_EN%202008.pdf,2002,Yes,The COI itself handed its report to Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.

157,432,0,"Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission","Commission Verité, Justice, et Reconciliation (Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission)","Mali gained independence from France in 1960 and was immediately thrust into a totalitarian regime that exploited its natural resources, repressed political opposition, and obstructed nation-building. In 1968, the regime was overthrown by a military coup, which banned political parties in the face of faced student unrest, political turmoil, and economic decline. During the nearly 25 years of the military regime, famine and drought compounded existing social cleavages, resulting in the rise of ethnic conflict, particularly among the ethnic Tuaregs in the North, whose nomadic territory had been divided between states during and after colonialization, and who were facing constraints on territorial movement due to rapid population growth and desertification. The Tuaregs were violently suppressed by the Malian army during an uprising in 1990. Cohesive opposition groups to the military regime ultimately coaligned during the “March Revolution”, enduring mass arrest, torture, and extrajudicial killing before overthrowing the regime in 1991. Despite the installation of a multi-party system with civil rights, there was still a high degree of conflict. Ethnic conflict persisted as many smaller groups considered the centralized government as unrepresentative of their needs and opinions. Calls for decentralization were strengthened with the return of many Tuaregs who had been living in Libya in 2011 after the fall of Gaddafi. This also added an armed element previously unseen; with transnational connections from northern Sahara, the Tuaregs established a reciprocally beneficial relationship with Islamic radical factions vying for control over territory and trade routes through the Sahel. Ultimately, armed Tuaregs launched a rebellion in 2012, prompting military officer Amadou Sanogo to seize control of the central government. This became a territory war; Tuaregs took control of the North, but were betrayed by Islamist groups, including AQIM, who fought for control in order to realize their goal of an Islamist republic. In 2013, France intervened at the request of the interim government and the UN Security Council established the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) to help the Malian military maintain control of the central and northern territories. Negotiations were finally successful after another year of factional violence in 2014, when armed groups and the government signed the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation. It included a provision for a Commission Verité, Justice, et Reconciliation (Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission) to cover the human rights violations ongoing essentially nonstop since 1960. With the installation of a transitional government and the formal creation of the CVJR by Ordonnance No. 2014-003, the Malian people had high hopes 2014-2015. But the CVJR got a slow start. The usual financial and logistical security issues were exacerbated by the fact that armed groups demanded a seat at the CVJR table, viewing it as another “bargaining chip” in the peace negotiation process. This is a fundamental misperception about CVJR truth-seeking that was not corrected; because the CVJR was subordinate to the Ministry of Reconciliation, it was forced to go along with the addition of commissioners “representative” of the armed groups due the interim government’s opinion that it must appease stakeholders in the peace negotiations to avoid potential spoilers. Critics were also unhappy about the CVJR’s lack of judicial power. Despite having “justice” in its name, it did not establish any formal judicial mechanisms, frustrating victims who considered the Malian judicial system corrupt and dysfunctional. Many victims’ groups advocated for sound administrative justice and were thus disappointed by the slim powers of the CVJR. However, its mandate was broad, covering all violations from 1960-2013, and victims were contented with the establishment of regional offices—a particularly important choice in a country where decentralization is such a key political issue. It established five sub-commissions: truth-seeking; victims’ support and reparations; gender; reconciliation and outreach; reporting and documentation. And, to date, the CVJR has heard or received written statements from 23,600 individuals proximal to the conflict. It is unclear if this includes perpetrators. It has also held 5 public hearings, each with a different topic, such as attacks on the right to freedom, attacks on physical integrity, forced disappearances, etc. Its mandate was originally capped at 2017, but it was extended in 2018 to 2021. At the end of 2021, the CVJR did not submit a report, however. It did submit confidential results and recommendations to the government, but according to recent interviews with commissioners and statements by government officials, the CVJR plans to publish a report in 2022. They have not received a mandate renewal, and yet, they held a final public hearing on sexual assault June 9, 2022, demonstrating that the CVJR is proceeding “as if”, likely a well-informed assumption. In relation to their confidential recommendations to the government, commissioners interviewed discussed their proposed 5-year policy for two institutions to take over its work: a reparations agency to address those victims recognized by the CVJR and a human rights institute that will continue to take statements. At this point, many victims’ and civil society groups are largely disillusioned with the unproductive process, so political will is rapidly evaporating. At some of the public hearings, testifiers have questioned the commissions failures, urging the commissioners to “fight” and “take action.” Nonetheless, the commissioners interviewed voice that they are proud of the work that they were able to do in the midst of active conflict and crisis, despite all of the critics. One positive is the passage of a 65 billion CFA franc (100 million euro) reparations plan in 2021.",domestic,domestic law,President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and Prime Minister Oumar Tatam,,,2014,2014-01-15,Agreement for Peace available at <http://cvjrmali.com/centre-de-documentat/> Ordonnance No. 2014-003 available at <http://cvjrmali.com/data/documents/ordce_cvjr-.pdf>,ongoing,0,2015,,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,1960-2013,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,,<http://cvjrmali.com/>,partially independent,Yes,25,"Ordonnance No. 2014-003 states “the members of the commission are chosen from among people of Malian nationality enjoying their civic rights and recognized for their moral integrity and their attachment to the values of tolerance, peace and justice.

38,165,0,Investigative Commission on the Kidnapping and Assassination of Former National Representatives Zelmar Michelini and Hector Gutierrez-Ruiz (Comision Investigadora sobre Secuestro y Asesinato Perpetrados contra los ex Legisladores Gutierrez-Ruizy,Investigative Commission on the Kidnapping and Assassination of Former National Representatives Zelmar Michelini and Hector Gutierrez-Ruiz (Comision Investigadora sobre Secuestro y Asesinato Perpetrados contra los ex Legisladores Gutierrez-Ruizy,"The Investigative Commission on the Kidnapping and Assassination of Former National Representatives Zelmar Michelini and Héctor Gutiérrez-Ruiz (Comisión Investigadora sobre Secuestro y Asesinato Perpetrados contra los ex Legisladores Héctor Gutiérrez-Ruiz y Zelmar Michelini) was established by the Uruguayan Chamber of Representatives on April 9, 1985. It began its work on April 23, 1985 and submitted its final reports to the Chamber on October 13, 1987. The Commission was one of few transitional justice initiatives adopted in Uruguay to investigate the grave human rights violations committed during the dictatorship of June 1973–March 1985. Article 1 of the resolution adopted on April 9, 1985, instituting the Commission, described the Commission's mission as “understanding and clarifying the kidnapping and assassination committed against legislators Héctor Gutiérrez-Ruiz, President of the Chamber of Deputies (Blanco Party), and Zelmar Michelini, Senator (Broad Front), in the city of Buenos Aires” (Report 1985, 63). The two Uruguayan legislators, who had been in voluntary exile in Buenos Aires (Argentina) since 1973, were kidnapped from their homes by armed men on May 18, 1976. Their bodies, with signs of torture on them, together with those of suspected Tupamaros guerrilla members William Whitelaw and Rosario Barredo, were found on May 21 in an abandoned car at the corner of Perito Moreno and Dellepiane Avenues in Buenos Aires. Political Background Between the mid- and the late 1980s, Uruguay's approach to transitional justice leaned toward amnesty and silence regarding the events of the recent past. As Alexandra Barahona de Brito (1997) highlighted, truth and justice were never dominant political themes in Uruguay, neither during the transitional electoral campaign of 1984 nor under the democratic government of the Colorado Party and President Julio Maria Sanguinetti (1985–1990). Although sympathetic to questions of accountability, none of the Uruguayan political parties decisively and effectively championed them on the national political agenda. Between 1985 and 1987, when the Commission worked, the political context became increasingly unfavorable to any further advancement of truth and justice. The Uruguayan journalist Florencia Melgar-Hourcade (2006) argued that the Commission's work cannot be detached from the specific context in which it operated, given that 1986 was “the same year when the discussion over whether or not turning the page [on the past] was being debated” (69). The Commission functioned in a tense political environment where the question of human rights constituted one of the thorniest issues for the first democratic administration. In terms of accountability, significant differences separated the executive from the opposition Blanco (National) Party and Frente Amplio (Broad Front), and from civil society, particularly victims’ organizations. Only the latter seriously worked for the elucidation of the past. Historian Oscar Destouet emphasized how “those who really worked for the establishment of the three Investigative Commissions were members of the Broad Front” (author's interview, Montevideo, November 3, 2009). The two other commissions he referred to were the Investigative Commission on the Situation of Disappeared People and Its Causes and the Investigative Commission Requested by Senator Juan Carlos Blanco Regarding His Conduct in the Ministry of External Relations in the Case of Elena Quinteros (see separate entries). In the case of the Commission discussed here, the Blanco Party supported the Broad Front. The executive's human rights policy focused only on national pacification and the repatriation of exiles; it actively and deliberately sidelined criminal prosecutions against those responsible for human rights abuses. As it wished to cover the past under the mantle of silence and oblivion, the Sanguinetti administration proposed no initiative to clarify it. Nonetheless, as early as April 1985, victims and their relatives began to bring to courts cases of human rights violations perpetrated by the security forces. By December 1986, more than 700 such cases were under investigation. The executive depicted the escalating tensions resulting from the lodging of all these cases as institutional crisis and uncertainty, and pointed to the likelihood of another military coup. Hence, in December 1986, Parliament enacted Law 15,848 on the Expiry of the Punitive Claims of the State (the Expiry Law), which effectively ended the possibility of achieving justice and clarifying the past. The law did not obstruct the work of the Commission, but it affected the achievement of justice in the case of the two legislators. On March 14, 1989, President Sanguinetti told to the Supreme Court that the assassination of the legislators fell within the remit of the law. Mission, Organization, and Activity The Commission was preceded by a Pre-Investigative Commission, created by the Chamber of Representatives on February 21, 1985. The Pre-Investigative Commission was also tasked with understanding and clarifying the kidnapping and assassination committed against legislators Michelini and Gutiérrez-Ruiz. It included legislators Yamandú Fau (Broad Front), Marino Irazoqui (Blanco), and Ramón Pereira-Parabén (Colorado), and supported the creation of an Investigative Commission, giving suggestions regarding its powers and duties. On April 9, 1985, the Chamber of Representatives considered the final report of the Pre-Investigative Commission and unanimously voted to set up the Commission. The founding resolution outlined the Commission's mandate, composition, and time frame. The Commission received broad powers of investigation to clarify and elucidate the crimes committed against the legislators (Article 1). It was to be composed of eleven deputies: five from the Colorado Party, four from the Blanco Party, and two from the Christian Democratic Party (Article 2). Thus, although the Broad Front had taken the lead in the creation of the Commission, in terms of composition, its delegates constituted the smallest group. The Commission's membership was to reflect the distribution of political parties in parliament and represent both the governing party (Colorado) and the opposition (Blanco and Broad Front). Article 3 gave the Commission ninety days to write its report, but that deadline was later extended. The Commission worked from April 1985 to August 14, 1987, when two, not one, final reports were drafted, reflecting the party line divisions that characterized this body. The Commission carried out various tasks. It collected 8,000 pages of documentation. In addition, Commission delegations traveled to Buenos Aires on three occasions to facilitate proceedings and requests for information. During these visits, delegates met with members of the Argentine judiciary and the executive. In Argentina, the Commission collected a variety of documents, particularly by consulting judicial records from ongoing trials and important testimonies. In Uruguay, it gathered more than twenty testimonies from individuals who voluntarily came forward or were purposely summoned. Among the most significant testimonies were those of the Blanco Party leader Wilson Ferreira-Aldunate, who in 1976 was in exile in Buenos Aires and narrowly survived an attempt on his life carried out a few days after Michelini and Gutiérrez-Ruiz were assassinated; and of Gutiérrez-Ruiz's widow, Matilde Rodríguez-Larreta, and of Michelini's sons, Zelmar-Eduardo and Luis-Pedro, who were all present when the legislators were taken away from their homes on May 18, 1976. Both Colonel Guillermo Ramírez and former Foreign Affairs Minister Juan-Carlos Blanco came before the Commission voluntarily, but several members of the security forces refused to give testimony. Former President Juan-María Bordaberry also declined the Commission's invitation, stating that “his presence was unnecessary” (Melgar-Hourcade 2006, 100). The final reports were both presented to Parliament in October 1987. The Majority Report was prepared and signed by six commissioners: four from the Blanco Party (Alem García, Jorge Machiñena, Luis José Martínez, and Alfredo Zaffaroni-Ortiz), one from the Broad Front (Yamandú Fau), and the other from the Christian Democratic Party (Gonzalo Carámbula). This report had six sections. In the introduction, it highlighted the Commission's tasks and reconstructed in detail the events that occurred the night of the kidnapping in Buenos Aires, the attempts by the victims’ families to protest their disappearance and locate them, the discovery of the bodies, and the lack of help and interest from the Argentinian and Uruguayan authorities. Then the close relationship and coordination in antisubversive activities between the Argentinian and Uruguayan military regimes at the time were described. The report identified the political and ideological differences between the two legislators and the Uruguayan regime, which were also the reasons for their exile. The regime publicly identified the two victims as its enemies, revoked their passports in November 1975, and later showed no interest in their fate. Next, the report considered the executive and its relations with the Commission and outlined four main conclusions. First, the kidnapping and assassination of the two legislators and of the other two victims “were carried out by criminals that depended operationally on the Argentinian Army.” The Commission found no proof “of direct participation” of Uruguayan nationals (Majority Report 1987, 549). Second, the Uruguayan authorities were deemed responsible for exposing the legislators to lethal danger and showing complete disinterest in elucidating what happened. Third, the Commission established that “illicit repressive activities” took place “with the participation of Uruguayan and Argentinian personnel” close to the time of the murders. Last, the Commission noted that the executive denied its repeated requests for cooperation and support to carry out a more complete investigation. The Minority Report was endorsed by five Colorado Party commissioners: Federico Bouza, Luis Hierro López, Mario Daniel Lamas, Oscar Magurno, and Edison Rijo. This four-page document recognized the importance of the Commission's work in terms of collecting relevant information and documents, but criticized it in two respects. First, it contended that the parliamentary Investigative Commission should not carry out tasks that belong to judges and that the investigation was better left in the hands of the judiciary, not the legislature. Second, it claimed that “the results obtained were of little importance” and that there were no elements that “allowed for the clarification of the events under investigation” (Minority Report 1987, 553–554). Both reports requested that they be forwarded by parliament, together with any other documentation not yet transmitted, to the Supreme Court. The reports were never publicly released or disseminated. Destouet noted that the executive's politics of silence and hiding resulted in these reports being immediately archived, “given that there was no political will to make this information accessible to all” (author's interview, Montevideo, November 3, 2009). President Sanguinetti disqualified the findings by claiming that “none of these investigations concluded with the clarification of the authorship of the crimes nor did they produce credible conclusions about them” (Barahona de Brito 1997, 146). The work of the Commission was affected by scandal on April 19, 1986, when the daily Uruguayan newspaper El País published the confidential declarations of two witnesses, Juliana De-Sarro and Haydée Trías, given to the Commission on April 7 and 8, 1986, respectively. Trías had openly declared that Army official Pedro Mato admitted to her his responsibility for Michelini's murder and further stated that military official Manuel Cordero was also involved in illicit activities in Buenos Aires at the time. The impact of this scandal was threefold: personal, legal, and institutional. The publication of these declarations intimidated potential witness by revealing the weakness of the Commission in terms of confidentiality and secrecy of the testimonies given. Although an investigation was initiated regarding the leakage of the witness declarations, parliament lost prestige and its reputation was damaged. After the scandal, the Commission slowed its activity and did not gather many more testimonies, as the guarantee of secrecy was fundamentally undermined. Tensions also emerged between commissioners who suggested that the Commission should submit its records to the judiciary and wrap up its activity and those in favor of letting it continue its work. Conclusion Legislator Felipe Michelini, one of Zelmar's sons, described the Commission's existence as “significant progress against the culture of impunity” that was dominant at the time (author's interview, Montevideo, November 11, 2009). Its work was notable, given the political obstacles it faced. Despite its inability to elucidate the case, the Commission carried out an essential task in terms of data collection. It recorded several critical testimonies and collected a wealth of information and documentation that would have been lost or forgotten. However, serious limitations affected its activity and results. As Felipe Michelini noted, this commission had unclear and limited responsibilities. It lacked subpoena powers and the capacity to request search warrants from the judiciary or establish an office abroad (given that the assassination occurred in another country). Despite repeated pleas, the Commission received no cooperation from the intelligence services, and the Ministries of Interior and Defense allowed no access to their archives. Overall, it had very limited resources at its disposal, and its members had to fund trips to Buenos Aires with their own resources. The impact of the leakage of secret testimonies cannot be underestimated. Finally, the executive showed disinterest, if not obstruction, to shedding light on the fate of the legislators. Judicial proceedings, brought to a close in 1989, reopened in 2002 to establish whether “the Uruguayan dictatorial regime had been the intellectual author of the murder of the two legislators” (Melgar-Hourcade 2006, 252). In June 2011, judge Roberto Timbal of Montevideo Tribunal 11 accepted district attorney Mirtha Guianze's request and condemned former President Juan María Bordaberry and Foreign Affairs Minister Juan Carlos Blanco to a thirty-year prison term – the maximum under the Uruguayan Penal Code – for the aggravated homicides of politicians Zelmar Michelini and Héctor Gutiérrez-Ruiz and of former guerrilla members Rosario Barredo and William Whitelaw. Bordaberry died while under house arrest on July 17, 2011. The Commission's troubled existence captures well the dilemmas of transitional justice in Uruguay. On the one hand, its creation reflected the continuing relevance of the past to the present, but this was only so for victims’ organizations and some political parties. On the other hand, the obstacles that the Commission faced in its work showed that the executive did not hold truth and justice as priorities. The enactment of the Expiry Law showed that the Sanguinetti administration had no intention of throwing light on the crimes of the past. Francesca Lessa, 2013.

195,500,0,The Commission of Inquiry into Violations of Human Rights,The Commission of Inquiry into Violations of Human Rights,"While a British protectorate, Uganda’s largest monarchy, Buganda, was given special status due to its size and economic weight. When Uganda gained its independence from Great Britain in 1962, the special status and the monarchy of Buganda—called the Kabaka—was preserved. At the time of independence, there was no dominant party in the rest of Uganda, but skilled negotiator Milton Obote united non-Bugandan politicians under the auspices of the Ugandan People’s Congress (UPC) by bonding over a mutual desire to rectify the regional inequality that buttressed Buganda’s special status. Hiding this underlying motive for the purposes of unification, the UPC allied with Bugandan royalists to win a Parliamentary majority, which elected Obote Prime Minister. It is important to note that Ugandan politics are very tribal in nature; the multiplicity of ethnic groups had so far not complicated politics because of Obote’s nation-building rhetoric. But by 1966, the UPC was tearing itself apart. In the midst of infighting, two factions emerged: the Northern Nilotic and the Southern and Bugandan Bantu. Obote conducted mass arrests, disappearances, and violent raids against Bantu during the late 1960s, culminating in a new constitution that dissolved the traditional kingdoms, removed the ceremonial power of the Kabaka, and installed Obote as President. Obote ordered General Idi Amin to attack the Kabaka palace. After conquering the Kabaka, General Idi Amin couped Obote in 1971, ruling a military junta for the next eight years. In addition to the repression of fundamental freedoms, he carried out mass killings and enforced disappearances—an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 Ugandans were killed by state security forces between 1971-79. In an attempt to whitewash his actions and legitimize his power and in response to demands from the families of the disappeared, Idi Amin created the Commission of Inquiry into the Disappearances of People in 1974. In 1978, after Ugandan Military began making incursions into Tanzanian territory, killing civilians, and looting, Tanzania declared war, invading Uganda with help from the Kikosi Maalum, a militia of Ugandan exiles in Tanzania. Idi Amin was overthrown. In 1980, Obote returned to the Presidency. Quickly, Bantu political-military forces that had gained prominence during the Uganda-Tanzania War led by liberationist Yoweri Museveni and jointly known as the National Resistance Army/Movement (NRA/NRM) began a guerilla insurgency known as the Ugandan Bush War. The CIA estimates that Obote’s regime killed 10,000 Ugandans during this time of complete political chaos 1980-86. Tribal, ethnic, and ideological factions vied for power within the UPC, ultimately resulting in an internal coup by the United National Liberation Army (UNLA). Angry that the revolution that they lit and kept burning had been hijacked, the NRA/NRM courted military aid from the former Zaire and attacked the UNLA. A decisive military victory installed Museveni as President, the office which he occupies today in an illiberal “competitive” authoritarian regime. In 1986, Museveni enacted Commission of Inquiry Act No. 5, which created the Commission of Inquiry into Violations of Human Rights. It was mandated to investigate an incredibly broad range of human rights violations from 1962-1986. It was composed of 6 commissioners, including one woman, and conducted public hearings in nearly every region of the country, ultimately collecting 608 testimonies. In 1994, it submitted its confidential report to President Museveni. Although much of its testimony had been televised or broadcast on the radio, the President never released the final report to the public. It is irretrievable from the Ministry of Public Service, which generally controls Ugandan government records. An assistant commissioner stated, “My guess is the Office of the President would still be in custody of the full report.” The Ugandan Human Rights Commission could also be in possession of the report. Several volumes of the COI’s archives were scanned by Professor Derek Peterson in 2022 at the University of Michigan. However, these scans, which document the minutes of every commissioner meeting and hearing, are nearly unreadable because of sheer proportions; each of the 8 scans is 1,000+ pages and filled with as much conversation as information. Beyond a violation of freedom of information and the right to truth, the confidentiality of the report is an even bigger disappointment because the COI had plans to disseminate it before going financially bankrupt in 1987. The remainder of its 7-year activities were covered by a $93,000 Ford Foundation grant. As this exemplifies, the COI lacked political will and was largely a way to appease human rights advocates. Like the 1974 COI, this COI was not sufficiently autonomous. It prohibited hearing “hearsay evidence which adversely affects the reputation of any person or tends to reflect in any way upon the character or conduct of any person…’ Also, “no expression of the opinion on the character, conduct, or motives of any persons shall be received in evidence.” This essentially prevented hearing evidence about perpetrators from anyone but the perpetrators themselves. Witnesses, while eligible for protection, could be cross-examined by the person adversely affected by their testimony, i.e. the perpetrator, should they violate the two former provisions. This further disincentivized witnesses from giving testimony, and even endangered witnesses by forcing a confrontation. However, some reports do claim that the commissioners tried hard to overcome these structural constraints. For example, Chair Oder “asked government to extradite Idi Amin and Milton Obote, both of whom were living in exile, on charges of violating human rights. Nothing came of this request, but Oder and his colleagues were full of confidence about their work. It was important to create a historical record, Oder argued.” While the COI certainly made recommendations, it is unclear what they contained. Reports allege that they focused on detainee treatment, detainment conditions, and other security sector reforms. We do know that before the new constitution in 1995, the COI recommended that the government create a permanent Human Rights Commission.

150,501,0,"The Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission","The Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission","Kenya has suffered tension between its many tribes since independence in 1963. Its two largest tribes have vied for economic and political power and manipulated and/or weaponized smaller tribes as leverage. Kenya’s first President, Jomo Kenyatta, was from the largest tribe (Kikuyu) and his Vice-President, Daniel Moi, was from the second largest tribe (Kalenjin). Upon Kenyatta’s death in 1978, Moi established a totalitarian state, censoring the media and repressing political opposition and members of other tribes through systematic human rights abuses, including encouraging corruption and violating economic, social, and cultural rights. He held power until constitutional reform restored multipartyism in 1991. However, Moi won the 1992 elections through widespread fraud to the condemnation of international and domestic observers. As allegations of fraud spread, Moi’s supporters and members of his Kalenjin ethnic group violently asserted his electoral win by killing, raping, and displacing thousands of Kikuyu members and supporters, prompting Kikuyu violent revenge weeks later. The Kenyan electoral system and civil service remained deeply flawed well into the mid-2000s. In 2007, tensions came to a head again. The closely contested presidential election was a reflection of a fragmented society, media hype, and strong ethnic nationalism. When the incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was announced the winner, opposition members called fraud and went on a violent rampage throughout the country, particularly focusing on the slums and Kikuyu members. International observers confirmed fraud but alleged that it was committed by both sides. The violence continued sporadically for several months, resulting in the death of 1,500 and displacement of 30,000. In January 2008, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan arrived in Nairobi and initiated peace negotiations, resulting in the National Accord, which included agreements to establish several commissions of inquiry. Several of the resulting COIs recommended the establishment of a truth commission, and after surveying the idea’s popularity, Parliament unanimously passed the Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Act on February 28, 2008. President Kibaki signed the TJRC into law on May 8, 2008. Hence, the TJRC is neither a post-conflict nor a post-authoritarian TC, although it is a post-atrocity TC mobilized by the political will leftover from the 2007 election violence. The TJRC was mandate was incredibly large; it was intended as a fact-finder, an agent of reconciliation, a vindication of victims’ economic, social, and cultural rights, and a medium of dialogue and coexistence. It had powers to summon and hold recalcitrant individuals in contempt. However, nearly immediately upon inauguration, the TJRC ran into a major controversy. Its Chair, Ambassador Bethuel Kiplagat, was a civil servant during the Moi regime and was allegedly connected to the Wagalla Massacre and the assassination of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko in 1990. Several victims’ groups filed for court injunctions to stop the TJRC operations, media leveled criminal allegations against him, and the Ministry of Justice called for a disbandment of the TJRC. Kiplagat refused to step down, only fanning the flames and prompting the resignation of the TJRC’s Vice-Chair, Betty Murungi. Ultimately, Kiplagat was temporarily removed and banned from contributing to or viewing the Final Report (see operations). The TJRC itself named him as a person recommended for prosecution. Throughout the TJRC’s 5-year period, there were also numerous setbacks. It lacked consistent funding due to multiple scandals impeding operations and prejudicing the government, resulting in insufficient funding when it was provided. There were also numerous allegations of corruption, resulting in a highly-publicized auditing process that concluded that the claims were unsubstantiated. Throughout the process, political and logistical odds were against the TJRC. Hence, its report surprised many of its critics. It was submitted in 2013 to the new president, President Kenyatta. The TJRC took 40,000 statements—the highest number of testimonies in TC history, —recommended 383 individuals for prosecution, and concluded that crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing had occurred under Moi’s regime. It also made recommendations, including a comprehensive Reparation Framework. While its mandate did include a provision for automatic implementation and required the creation of an Implementation Committee to oversee not only implementation, but the public availability of the TJRC’s archives, this Committee was never established, and no recommendations have been followed. In many ways, this is the TJRC’s own fault; due to its numerous scandals, it lost public trust and prolonged its operations for too long, resulting in an evaporation of political will. Its reconciliation function was also replaced with the Building Bridges Initiative, which created communication channels between the ruling party and opposition, resulting in a slowed momentum for justice that could potentially disturb this tentative peace. Several former and active military members, politicians in office, and ethnic group leaders have also sued the TJRC and/or government to prevent the publishing of the final report, to expunge certain sections of the report, and even to block the implementation of certain recommendations. Hoping for popularity, no democratic spoilers, and impunity for himself as he is investigated by the ICC, President Kenyatta has allowed the TJRC’s final report to fade into a “political ghost”.",hybrid,domestic law,President Mwai Kibaki and Minister of Justice Martha Karua,,<https://www.usip.org/publications/2009/07/truth-commission-kenya>,2008,2008-05-08,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Kenya-Charter.pdf>,completed,0,2009,,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,"December 12, 1963 to February 28, 2008",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Kenya-Charter.pdf>,partially independent,Yes,7,"The Minister of Justice created an 9-person “selection panel” with 2 representatives nominated by a forum of the 6 largest Kenyan religious organizations; 1 person nominated by the Law Society of Kenya; 1 person nominated by the Federation of Kenya Women Lawyers; 1 person jointly nominated by the Central Organization of Trade Unions and the Kenya National Union of Teachers; 1 person nominated by the Association of Professional Societies of East Africa; 1 person nominated by the Kenya National commission on Human Rights; 1 person jointly nominated by the Kenya Private Sector Alliance and the Federation of Kenya Employers; 1 person nominated by the Kenya Medical Association.

180,732,0,The May 18 Democratization Fact-Finding Investigation Committee,5·18민주화운동 진상규명조사위원회 (The May 18 Democratization Fact-Finding Investigation Committee),"After the 3-year Korean War, internal violence did not abate in the Southern Republic of Korea (ROK). President Sygman Rhee instituted martial law, continuing repression under his autocratic regime. In 1960, university students orchestrated a mass protest movement known as the April Revolution, gaining enough traction with other interest groups to topple the regime. A brief democratic government failed to consolidate power—its policies failed, and its purges of anti-democratic military and police led to instability, and ultimately a military coup marshaled by Major General Park in 1961. In 1963, Park organized and won elections. Initially, social and economic reforms increased the standard of living, winning Park a second term, but he made successive power grabs in the 70s, removing his term limits, neutralizing veto players, and rigging the elections. By the mid-70s, his authoritarianism targeted not only opposition, but also students, intellectuals, and religious figures through the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. In 1979, mass demonstrations and intense instability led to Park’s assassination, precipitating another coup by Major General Chun. The resulting martial law put troops in nearly every town in the country, a violent reminder that despite decades of protests and almost 30-years of struggle for democracy, the military status quo persisted. Students in the southwestern city of Gwangju organized protests beginning on May 18, 1980. The protest movement grew rapidly—protesters numbered nearly a quarter million and included South Koreans of all ages and political beliefs. Chun sent two battalions of ROK troops to quell the protests, resulting in a massacre that continued until the 27th, when helicopters and tanks indiscriminately attacked the city. Official government estimates put the death toll at 200, but victims and research groups insist that it is closer to 2,000. For most of Korean history, the words “Gwangju” and “May 18th” have been taboo, especially because of Chun’s regimes relative geopolitical success. General Chun solidified the longstanding US-South Korea alliance and retained some popularity with gradual social, economic, and political liberalization. In 1987, opposition parties gained enough political traction to force regime change, enacting a new constitution and democratic rule. Still, even after democratization, little new information was learned about the Gwangju massacre. In the 1990s, victims’ groups and researchers began local-level initiatives for truth. After a series of other truth commissions in the early 2000s, and notably, after the release of General Chun’s memoirs denying responsibility for the massacre, the National Assembly finally enacted the Special Law for Investigation of the Truth of the May 18th Democratization Movement on March 13, 2018. The Special Law creates a May 18 Democratization Fact-Finding Investigation Committee, which was originally attended to complete its work in time for the 40th anniversary of the Gwangju massacre. Unfortunately, its mandate has been extended until the end of 2022. The Committee is composed of 9 multidisciplinary commissioners, including one woman. The Committee is an event-specific post-atrocity truth commission, not a just a post-conflict or post-authoritarian truth commission. Nonetheless, the scope of the Committee’s investigation is wide—""cases of death, injury, disappearance, burial, and other serious human rights violations and suspicion of manipulation.” Sexual abuse was recently added to this scope. The Committee is intended to determine individual responsibility for the crimes, to recognize and provide a true count of the victims, and to organize memorialization. Interestingly, the Special Law also asks to Committee to weigh the possibility of a Special Prosecutor for the May 18th violence. If a Special Prosecutor is established, the Committee will support prosecutions with evidence. The Committee has wide powers to acquire such evidence. It can summon and impose a fine for non-compliance with summons, and has full access to government files, although the relevant government institution can prevent publication of certain files. The Committee has so far taken 1,034 testimonies. It has also taken blood from the families of 367 missing persons. Recently, it also received 140 pages of declassified US State Department documents. The Committee plans to request further US archives. If the Committee determines that there is prima facie evidence that a crime has been committed by a perpetrator, the Committee can submit its evidence to the public prosecutor. Similarly, if the Committee finds evidence that a court erred in its ruling on a past trial regarding crimes in the scope of the Committee’s investigation, the Committee can recommend retrial. The Committee also has the power to recommend immunity. If a perpetrator cooperates with the Committee fully, both insofar as recounting his own acts and operating as an informant about other perpetrators and violations, then the Committee can recommend that person for immunity should they be criminally prosecuted. Clearly, this is not a direct exchange of amnesty for testimony, both because it is immunity, not amnesty, so only after criminal prosecution could the perpetrator be pardoned and because the Committee cannot grant the immunity— only the president can grant pardons. So far, the Committee has released four activity reports, two in 2020 and two in 2021. No conclusions or recommendations have yet been drawn.",domestic,domestic law,The National Assembly,,,2018,2018-03-13,"an annex in the 2020 activity report I, available here: <https://www.518commission.go.kr/fnt/bbm/bbs/selectBoardArticleView.do?nttId=5738&menuNo=3400000&menuSubNo=3410000>",ongoing,0,2019,,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,May 1980,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,,,fully independent,Yes,9,"Four commissioners are recommended by the National Assembly—to guarantee multisectoral involvement and impartiality, one from each party.

142,452,0,National Reconciliation Commission,National Reconciliation Commission,"Since independence from British rule in 1957, Ghana has experienced four successful military coups and numerous attempted coups. All these conflicts, as well as the authoritarianism, structural violence, and militarization of society produced as a result, generated extensive human rights violations and abuses. After its independence, the lack of consensus regarding state organization and the hostility of sociocultural, tribal, and religious groups against each other generated a newborn state that was already aggressive towards opposition. This was facilitated by the massive raw material wealth exploited and enjoyed by small sector of Ghanian elite, leading to inequality, which drove class conflict, and structural-institutional barriers to access of political expression. Still, Ghanaians were largely optimistic as President Nkrumah was popularly appointed. However, he was deposed by a military coup in 1966 to “restore order” after the economy declined. This began the cycle of military coup --> democratic elections and a new republic --> economic decline --> military coup. Each military government grew increasingly more violent, arbitrarily arresting, torturing, and repressing the political freedom of opposition parties and activists. Students, the rural poor, and leftists were targeted. This cycle continued through the 80s, when Jerry Rawlings seized power through an intra-military uprising. Rawlings consolidated totalitarianism, dissolving parliament and banning political parties. However, he was extremely popular among the rural poor and leftists due to connections with communist and socialist nations. This greatly discontented the military and neighboring countries, resulting in several unsuccessful attempts to overthrow Rawlings, including one engineered by neighboring Togo. As the economy declined, Rawlings’ unpopularity prompted democratic reforms, with a new constitution passed in 1992. Surprisingly, Rawlings won the first multi-party election approved by independent observers as free and fair. He won again in 1996, despite a declining economy prompting land conflicts between sociocultural and tribal rural groups. However, his party split due to conflict relating to water shortage, more land conflict, and student demonstrations are violently repressed by police. In 2000, Rawlings presidency ended and President John Kufour was elected. While riots occurred and Ghana continued to be plagued by structural and institutional violence, this was a hopeful beginning for the consolidation of democracy. In 2002, Parliament enacted the National Reconciliation Commission Act, promulgated by President Kufour on January 9, 2002. The NRC aimed to promote reconciliation through historical truth, and was granted considerable powers, including the power to summon testimony, subpoena documents, and legally punish those who did not comply with summons or subpoenas. Its mandated period was March 6, 1957 and January 6, 1993. The NRC was well-received by the public. According to a footnote anecdote, when commissioners and staff arrived at the NRC building the first day of operations, there was already over 60 petitioners lined up outside. The first, a 70-year-old man, had arrived at the headquarters at 3:00 AM to ensure his voice was heard. It initially received 4,240 petitions, about 400 fell outside of the NRC’s jurisdiction, either because they were outside the mandated time period or did not involve a state agent. Overall, the NRC recognized 8,686 victims that suffered 12,517 violations, indicating that most victims suffered 2 or more violations. In its final report, released in 2004, the NRC concluded that not all violations were confined to unconstitutional/authoritarian governments, although the majority of violations did occur during these regimes. Abductions and detentions peaked during the AFRC and PNDC regimes, during which period 84% of all violations (not just abductions and detentions) occurred. 66.3% of violations were committed by military perpetrators, with the remaining % of violations largely committed by the Police Service and the Prison Service. Children were a significant victim group, largely associated with violations of sexual abuse or killing. Economic hardship, bankruptcy, family disintegration, lack of education for children and health problems were the main long-term effects of the violations on the victims as indicated in their statements. The report also makes hundreds of recommendations, including significant security sector reform, constitutional reform, student- and youth-oriented reform, religious-oriented reform, memorialization efforts, and a comprehensive reparations plan including a breakdown of economic reparations according to violation type. However, the report was criticized for being too expensive for the average person, thus reducing its accessibility and impact on Ghanaian society. Additionally, President Kufour did not take many of the NRC’s recommendations. Significantly, few changes were made to the structural and institutional incentives for violence in Ghanaian political life that led to instability in the first place. A reparations plan was put in place, but the government took little action other than economic reparations, disappointing many who expected more symbolic, infrastructural, and material action after this comprehensive transitional justice mechanism. This coupled with the lack of prosecution of perpetrators signified to many impartial and Ghanaian observers that the political elite who enjoyed impunity throughout authoritarianism continued to maintain impunity and influence.",domestic,domestic law,Parliament and President John Agyekum Kufour,,,2002,2002-01-09,<http://www.ghanareview.com/reconact.html>,completed,0,2002,<https://hmcwordpress.humanities.mcmaster.ca/Truthcommissions/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ghana.NRC_.Report-FULL.pdf> <http://www.ghanareview.com/reconact.html>,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,"March 6, 1957 and January 6, 1993",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,8686,<http://www.ghanareview.com/reconact.html> <https://hmcwordpress.humanities.mcmaster.ca/Truthcommissions/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ghana.NRC_.Report-FULL.pdf>,fully independent,Yes,9,"They were appointed by the President and in consultation with the Council of State according to their “integrity, sense of fairness and ability of the persons to achieve the object of the Commission,” according to the NRC Act of 2002.",,Yes,,,<http://www.ghanareview.com/reconact.html> <https://hmcwordpress.humanities.mcmaster.ca/Truthcommissions/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ghana.NRC_.Report-FULL.pdf> <http://media.africaportal.org/documents/Vol_22-PeaceVsJustice.pdf>,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,<http://www.ghanareview.com/reconact.html>,Yes,4240,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,http://www.ghanareview.com/reconact.html https://hmcwordpress.humanities.mcmaster.ca/Truthcommissions/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ghana.NRC_.Report-FULL.pdf,2004,Yes,"The NRC published its own report, the highly respected Ghanaian Center for Democracy and Development synthesized and published an executive summary, also in 2004.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,0,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,"Memorialization in terms of Museums, stamps, coins, badges as well as maintaining public records and a documents.

172,517,0,National Unity and Reconciliation Commission,commission nationale d’unité et de reconciliation (National Unity and Reconciliation Commission),"Rwanda has a long history of ethnic conflict between minority Tutsis and majority Hutus. Due to Belgian colonizers’ active favoritism toward Tutsis and discrimination against Hutus, the Hutu majority demanded a power transfer after independence, militarizing and violently purging Tutsi communities. This prompted a mass Tutsi exodus to neighboring Burundi, Uganda, and the former Zaire (DRC). In 1973, Hutu army officer Juvénal Habyarimana conducted a coup and founded the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) party, in which membership was mandatory, officially making Rwanda a one-party state. Meanwhile, the thousands of Tusti refugees in Uganda established the Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR) and joined the Ugandan Army, where FPR leaders orchestrated a mass recruitment and training scheme for the invasion of Rwanda in October 1990. The Tutsi-led FPR targeted Hutu civilians, prompting the Hutu-led Rwandan Armed Forces (AFR) to retaliate against Tutsi civilian populations. In January 1993, civil society organizations demanded a COI, prompting four international NGOs to establish the internationale d’enquête sur les violations des droits de l’homme au Rwanda depuis le 1er Octobre 1990 (International Commission of Investigation on Human Rights Violations in Rwanda Since October 1, 1990). This COI concluded that acts of genocide were committed by both sides (see Rwanda 1993), and encouraged the negotiations ongoing in Arusha, which were signed in August 1993. In the next year tensions only rose, and the Hutu Power gained political traction independent of President Habyarimana. In April 1994, President Habyarimana was murdered and the Hutu Power movement orchestrated the “final solution” of extermination of the Tutsis, killing between 500,000 to 1 million Tutsis in the span of 100 days in what became known as the Rwandan genocide. The RPF quickly regrouped, gaining territory, pushing the AFR and Hutu Power movement into the former Zaire (where they formed the rebel Army for the Liberation of Rwanda [ALiR]), and placing RPF leader Paul Kagame in power as the de facto president. The RPF formed the Government of National Unity, which was loosely based on the 1993 Arusha Accords, but outlawed the MRND and attacked Hutu refugee camps in Zaire within a few months. The RPF remains in power to this day. Regardless, an unstable peace persisted. Initially provided for in Art. 24 of the Arusha Accords and codified into Art. 9 of the 1991 Constitution, le commission nationale d’unité et de reconciliation (National Unity and Reconciliation Commission) was formally mandated in Law No. 03/99 of March 12, 1999, by President Pasteur Bizimungu. Its mandate was quite unique. It did not have a set duration of time to complete its work; it had no formal powers of investigation; it did not even have a specified period of interest. Its work references abuse back to colonialism. The NURC had a very limited fact-finding function; the words “truth” and “victim” do not appear in its mandate. Instead, its mandate is much more substantive and outreach-based; beyond promoting unity and reconciliation, it has the two special functions of monitoring government policy and political parties for respect for human rights and educating the Rwandese people about their own rights and the rights of others. It is not adequately formally independent, perhaps to preserve the newfound power of the FPR; its 12 commissioners are appointed to 3-year terms by the President and subject to removal at any time. Their terms can be renewed, but this created an organizational incentive system for the commissioners to cater to the “official” historical and transitional narratives promoted by the President and the overall FPR. That being said, this does not seem to have been too much of an interference with the NURC’s work; it criticizes the government freely in its annual reports. The NURC functioned 1999-2001 before it was converted into a permanent state organ by Law No. 35/2002 of November 14, 2002. Its 2000 annual report discusses the progress of its three departments: the Civic Education Department, which focuses on the “training of new leaders” at schools, the Conflict Mediation Department, which fosters positive and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and Community Initiatives Department. Each engages in grassroots consultations and local programs with regularity, even establishing subnational offices in many of the prefectures. In 2000, the NURC also established an ad hoc commission that surveyed the population about how they conceive of unity and reconciliation, what they perceived as the biggest obstacles to this effect, and what actions can be taken. It also conducted outreach about the concerns and dangers of the unofficial, alternative justice Gacaca courts and created a reparations draft law, a ‘rights of the child’ draft law, and a draft law criminalizing discrimination in all its forms. Its 2001 report expands on this, accounting the implementation of these plans and the steps the government had taken toward human rights. The NURC succeeded in passing its draft law criminalizing discrimination through the National Assembly, supported Ingando reeducation and rehabilitation initiatives nationwide, began to organize a documentation center of books and government documents concerning the conflict and Rwandan history accessible to the public, established a scholarly journal for research about the conflict, created TV, radio, musical, and comic book content about the principles of reconciliation, conducted training sessions about unity and reconciliation with teachers, journalists, and local public figures, and formalized a national syllabus for human rights education in schools. Both reports also offer recommendations, largely about legal and constitutional reform, reparations and restitution of land, and judicial regulation and aid to the Gacaca courts.",domestic,domestic law,"The Government of National Unity, signed into law by President Pasteur Bizimungu",,,1999,1999-03-12,<https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b59a18.html>,completed,0,1999,<https://www.nurc.gov.rw/fileadmin/Documents/Others/Unity_and_Reconciliation__Process_in_Rwanda.pdf> <https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b59a18.html>,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,yes,0,0,1,No,,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1000000,<https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b59a18.html>,partially independent,Yes,12,"Appointed by Presidential order on the advice of the Cabinet; required to be at least 21 and known for their moral integrity, good behavior and competence.",Yes,Yes,78,2899072,<https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b59a18.html> <https://www.usip.org/publications/1999/03/truth-commission-rwanda-99>,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,<https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b59a18.html>,No,,No,No,No,No,,,,2002,Yes,"Issued annual reports, including two (2000 and 2001) while still a temporary body.

123,482,0,"Truth, Justice, Reparation, and Reconciliation Commission","Commission Verité, Justice, Réparation, et Réconciliation (Truth, Justice, Reparation, and Reconciliation Commission)","Before the Central African Republic was granted provisional independence from France in 1958, Barthélémy Boganda, an anti-colonialist who spoke out against racism, was the first African to be elected to the all-French government. He went on to establish a political party (MESAN) that captured a majority of votes in the 1957 election but died in a plane crash before formal independence in 1960. His cousin, David Dacko, forced political opponents into exile, banned all political parties other than MESAN, and led a totalitarian regime until a coup staged by Jean-Bédel Boukassa on New Year’s Eve 1965. Boukassa declared himself Emperor, pillaged the nation’s natural resources, trafficked arms, and conducted a massive corruption ring. With the help of the French Army, Dacko regained the presidency in a 1981 coup, but was overthrown in 1981 by General André Kolingba. Kolingba led a military junta, but legalized political parties and allowed for semi-free parliamentary elections, although massive violence campaigns were orchestrated against opponents with any chance of success. This seeming willingness to reform in addition to the decline of the Soviet Union and pressure from the international community led to a pro-democracy movement. Despite the free and fair election of President Patassé, violence in the CAR increased; Kolingba’s supporters alleged that the government was conducting a “witch hunt” against them, corruption was rampant, and three consecutive mutinies generated ethnic conflict 1996-7. At this time, armed groups began controlling territory, signaling the civil war to come. President Patassé likely exacerbated this by contracting Congolese and Libyan soldiers. In 2003, a rebel leader, Françoise Bozizé, staged a coup, creating a multi-party, opposition-inclusive National Assembly, but in 2004, rebel and guerilla forces, most notably the FPDC, CPJP, and UFDR, began attacking the state in what has been called a ‘Bush War’, again leading to French involvement in defense of Bozizé. In 2007-9, hostilities declined and calls for transitional justice surfaced. However, generalized insecurity led to the failure not only of the transitional justice efforts, but also the peace agreement. In 2013, a rebel coalition Séléka seized the north, central, and the capital Bangui, but the coalition disbanded later in 2013, not only shattering budding peace deals but also allowing Christian “anti-balaka” vs. Muslim rebel violence to veer farther from government control. In 2016, President Faustin Archange Touadéra won elections overseen by the AU and peace negotiations began again. While previous peace deals had been negotiated by elites outside of CAR, new negotiations were a years-long process between and among armed groups, resulting in the 2019 Khartoum Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation between the government and 14 armed groups. The Agreement embraced a DDR strategy; 13 militant leaders have been incorporated into ministerial-level government positions and low-level, limited amnesty was offered. The Agreement also included a provision for la Commission Verité, Justice, Réparation, et Réconciliation, which was formalized by Law No. 20.009 in April 2020. Prior to the enactment of the law, the government consulted 1,977 participants from different religious groups, minorities, political parties, etc. and used their wishes and recommendations as the basis for the law. The mandate of the CVJRR is extremely ambitious: all human rights violations, causes, and consequences from March 29, 1959 until December 31, 2019 in 4 years with the possibility of a 1-year extension in a context where armed conflict persists and resources are slim. Initiated in July 2021 with the appointment of its 11 commissioners, the CVJRR has already come into controversy. The selection process of the commissioners was extremely opaque and member of the selection committee described it as a “matter of camaraderie,” claiming that representation is only artificial and the government did everything in its power to guarantee that “people of its own persuasion” packed the commission to back the “official” government narratives. Further, it has become clear that misunderstandings about certain provisions of the Agreement persist, including regarding amnesty. Now that the CVJRR is actively claiming there will not be impunity for armed group members, concerns about armed groups becoming spoilers are legitimate. However, the CVJRR does have considerable power. It can compel testimony and subpoena documents via the power of injunction, and can solicit assistance from the public prosecutor’s office to perform searches and seizures, but Law No. 20.009 does not include any provision about the public prosecutor enforcing compliance with summons or subpoenas under the law. The law also specifies that any person who testifies is “released from professional secrecy,” presumably so that authorities can reveal the truth about certain confidential operations, but one might ask what power the CVJRR can wield to demand that France, Russia, China or even the CAR authorities reveal the truth about events without judicial power. In addition to public hearings, it holds thematic hearings and encourages traditional methods of conflict resolution, including victim-perpetrator confrontations and forgiveness. If victims “freely” grant their forgiveness and a “friendly settlement procedure” is reached between the two parties, then the CVJRR considers this reparations procedure res judicata. While it is commendable that the CVJRR is encouraging nontraditional forms of justice, especially in indigenous, ethnic, and local spaces, it does raise questions about the level of pressure that that victims in central CAR, which is still largely controlled by armed groups, will experience to grant “forgiveness.” Began in July 2021 with the swearing in of its commissioners, but did not have a budget, facilities, or security as armed groups continued violence. This did not stop its operations; by December 2021, it had finalized its rules of procedures and held popular meetings with victims and stakeholders. And yet, in 2022, victims groups have voiced their demands that the CVJRR accelerate its work to directly address their needs, and have held several demonstrations to this effect. The biggest concern is security; commissions with much smaller mandates have failed due to ongoing violence hindering their process and the CVJRR can hardly make recommendations toward non-recurrence and prevention when violations are a part of daily life.",domestic,domestic law,Passed by Parliament and signed into law by President Faustin Archange Touadéra,,,2019,2019-02-06,<https://cps-rca.cf/documentation.php?idcategorie=14>,ongoing,0,2021,,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,no,no,1,1,1,Yes,"March 29, 1959 to December 31, 2019",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,,<https://cps-rca.cf/documentation.php?idcategorie=14>,partially independent,Yes,11,"Law No. 20.009 states that they “are personalities recognized for their notoriety, their commitment to peace, their moral integrity and ability to transcend divisions of all kinds.

111,615,0,National Panel for Dialogue and Mediation,L’Instance Nationale de Dialogue et Médiation INDM (National Panel for Dialogue and Mediation),"L’Instance Nationale de Dialogue et Médiation (INDM) was create in response to the Algerian political crisis in 2019, which demanded the resignation of four-term illiberal totalitarian President Bouteflika. Since the 1992-99 Civil War, the Algerian political system was characterized by Bouteflika’s state monopolization of natural resources in order to maintain funding for corporatism within the ruling party and clientelism with state supporters, paramilitaries, and police on the ground to guarantee “stability”. Mass protest, led by student and Islamic groups, collectively called the “Hirak”, began in February 2019, the day after President Bouteflika announced his bid for a fifth presidential term. Police suppression of protests turned violent, with hundreds injured and illegally detained without charge, prompting army dispatch. The protestors demanded a complete overhaul of the political system, sending the state into political turmoil, prompting military reaction and the resignation of Bouteflika. The constitution holds that the president of the Council of Nation is second-in-command when the President is removed, prompting the accession of Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah for 90 days. Bensalah established the INDM July 25, 2019, with the expressed mission to facilitate elections as soon as possible by creating the conditions for dialogue between Algeria’s many political factions, including the Hirak, and creating a series of proposals to facilitate respect for civil liberties in the government elected by the next elections. The reports of Bensalah’s inaugural speech emphasize that the INDM was intended to collect proposals from different points of view and initiate dialogue between different political factions. Bensalah stressed that “the mission of this body will be completed once a new president is elected.” Because of the hectic legal and political climate, it is unclear whether the INDM was created by presidential decree or legislation and the charter appears unavailable online. However, it is known that the INDM included 7 commissioners: the former president of the National Assembly Karim Younes, the former senator Bouzid Lazhari, public law professor Fatiha Benabou, entrepreneur Smaïl Lalmas, trade unionist Abdelwahad Bendjelloul, academic Azzedine Benaissa, and student leader of Hirak Yacine Boukhnifer, who is considered a victim group leader. The INDM was intended to produce a final report wherein it will draw a series of final proposals which will be mandatorily adopted “within the framework of a sovereign National Conference whose decisions will be binding on the public authorities”. The INDM met with 23 political parties and more than 6,075 political figures and associations, including “hundreds of youths”, in order to formulate its proposals. Certain political parties and groups rejected the INDM’s invitation to share their perspective on the crisis, but the president of INDM, Karim Younes, emphasized that this was a reflection of certain interest groups’ inherent opposition to dialogue from the very beginning of the process due to the incentive structure created by Bouteflika’s clientelist system. Furthermore, many youth political groups that participated in the Harik movement rejected the INDM as futile, claiming that there could be no dialogue with Bouteflika sympathizers. Younes pointed out that groups have the right to reject dialogue, but since not all groups are against it, it appears to be the best option for reconciliation, asking such interest groups if they had “any better ideas.” The fact that Younes publicly called out not only the clientelism of the Bouteflika regime but also the naivety of the Harik movement indicates considerable independence from both political structures. The INDM completed a final report in August 2019 and delivered it directly to Interim President Bensalah. While it was announced by the press that the report would be distributed among political and civil society parties, leaders, and associations, it is unclear if this public distribution ever actually occurred. In the report, the INDM proposed a new constitution to “overhaul… the legislative mechanism for the organization of elections, the moralization of public life, [and] overhaul… the organization and management methods of the State and its branches”. In order to mediate upcoming elections to usher in this transitional period, the INDM recommended creating “an independent national authority responsible for the preparation, organization and monitoring of the electoral process.” Ultimately, this resulted in two important governmental institutions after the dissolution of INDM: Le Conseil Consultatif de l'instances de dialogue et de mediation in August 2019, which was essentially a glorified electoral commission to prepare and monitor presidential elections to guarantee freedom and fairness and L’Instance de la médiation de la République established by Presidential Decree 20-45 February 15, 2020 to fight against institutional and systemic problems in the country’s bureaucracy in order to preserve civil liberties and prevent corruption.

131,437,0,"Commission on Dialogue, Truth, and Reconciliation","Commission Dialogue, Verité, et Réconciliation, (Commission on Dialogue, Truth, and Reconciliation)","Côte d’Ivoire was divided along religious and ethnic lines in anticipation for 2000 elections, in which Alassane Ouattara, a Muslim, announced his candidacy. In 1999, the military conducted a coup, led by General Guei, and promised to hold the 2000 elections. However, they barred Ouattara and other candidates from running on the basis of their ethnicity and parental nationalities. The Ouattara-led opposition boycotted the 2000 elections, resulting in candidate Laurent Gbagbo’s lead. However, the military did not approve of Gbagbo and stopped the elections midway through counting, declaring General Guei as the winner. Within hours, Gbagbo and his armed forces had taken the city of Abidjan, resulting in violence. When Gbagbo was declared president, Ouattara and the opposition also engaged in combat. In 2001, Gbagbo and Ouattara established a ceasefire in an effort at reconciliation, but violence continued due to fertility gaps in land that benefited the Ivorian Muslim population. The military mutinied, resulting in the First Ivorian Civil War (2002-2004), during which severe human rights abuses were committed. An unstable peace was pursued after 2004, with Gbagbo continuing to attack MPIGO and MJP rebels. Tensions rose again in anticipation of the 2010 elections. Ouattara won, but Gabagbo loyalists declared the results invalid and Gbagbo launched a military offensive against Ouattara, resulting in the Second Ivorian Civil War (2010-2011). Gbagbo’s forces committed brutal assassination campaigns against Ouattara’s primarily Muslim supporters. The UN helped broker a peace deal and Gbagbo was ultimately arrested, but aftershocks of violence remained with a fractured opposition and severe societal division. In order to facilitate social cohesion and attain reconciliation, Ouattara created the Commission Dialogue, Verité, et Réconciliation by Decree No. 2011-85 of May 13, 2011, later replaced by Decree No. 2011-167 of July 13, 2011. It had a broad mandate with no specified time period but insufficient powers as it could not attribute responsibility and could not access official documents. Its scope was not clearly defined, and unfortunately was plagued by severe political partiality. This is largely due to its centralization around its President, commissioner Charles Konan Banny, who was Prime Minister during Gbagbo’s presidency and was Ouattara’s advisor in the run-up to the 2010 presidential elections. Critics claim that he attempted to use the CDVR as a mechanism to build his political clout due to presidential ambitions. The CDVR also did not involve civil society or victims’ groups and was considerably dysfunctional. In its initial period, the CDVR only focused on establishing a narrative of the structural causes of conflict. This is regrettable, considering that the structural causes of conflict were already well-known. The CDVR essentially wasted two year and considerable money on its Special Heuristics Commission, resulting in the neglect of its other Specialized Hearings and Investigation Commission, Reparations Commission, and Memorial Commission. Hence, when it turned in its initial report in 2013, almost none of its mandate was fulfilled and no truth had been verified. Ouattara thus renewed CDVR’s mandate for another year by Decree No. 2014-32 of February 3, 2014. The Final Report of the CDVR, submitted September 2014, was much more fleshed-out, but still remained inadequate. It concluded that the most violations (46.87%) occurred 2011-2013, and that of the 72,574 violations, 7,486 were homicides, 1,995 were cases of disappearances, 5,229 were cases of serious injuries and 5,466 were cases of torture and illtreatment. However, despite having taken 72,483 testimonies, only 28% of those testimonies were victims and largely all the violations the CDVR reports were committed by Gbagbo loyalists or armed forces. Additionally, the opposition continued to reject the government’s legitimacy and conduct violent raids. This resulted in the public sentiment that the CDVR lacked the political will to reconcile and carried out a bureaucratic process that one-sidedly blamed Gbagbo for all violations and resulted in no real dialogue. The CDVR did issue recommendations, notably relating to land policy, education, democratic accountability, poverty reduction, and gender parity. However, none of these recommendations have been implemented and Ouattara continues to deny responsibility for any human rights violations. He has also made consecutive power grabs since the end of the CDVR, including being elected for a third term in an unfree and seemingly unfair election. Overall, ethnic divides are still opportunistically manipulated for political power. While Ouattara did establish a Special Investigative Unite (CSEI) in 2011, it has only investigated Gbagbo loyalists, many of whom are deprived due process as they remain detained despite no formal charges or trial. Ouattara also invited the ICC to prosecute Gbagbo for his crimes, resulting in international prosecution of Laurent Gbagbo, his wife Simone Gbagbo, and the former Minister of Youth Charles Blé Goude for crimes against humanity. These cases are in progress. Côte d'Ivoire retained Simone Gbagbo, however, and convicted her along with 78 other suspects for endangering state security in March 2015.",domestic,domestic law,https://www.gouv.ci/doc/presse/1477497207RAPPORT%20FINAL_CDVR.pdf,,,2011,2011-05-31,,completed,0,2011,<https://www.gouv.ci/doc/presse/1477497207RAPPORT%20FINAL_CDVR.pdf>,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,yes,0,1,1,No,,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,72574,<https://www.gouv.ci/doc/presse/1477497207RAPPORT%20FINAL_CDVR.pdf>,not independent,Yes,11,"Appointed by President Ouattara, the commissioners exhibit “competence, legitimacy, and trust,” and are “representative of Ivoirian society” according to the final report.",Yes,Yes,388,13000000000,<https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2014/01/13/cote-d-ivoire-truth-panel-seen-faltering> <https://www.gouv.ci/doc/presse/1477497207RAPPORT%20FINAL_CDVR.pdf> <https://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Africa_Truth_Commissions1.html#c%C3%B4te-divoire> <https://www.mcgill.ca/humanrights/files/humanrights/monteiro_eva_ihrip_v8_2020.pdf>,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,<https://www.gouv.ci/doc/presse/1477497207RAPPORT%20FINAL_CDVR.pdf>,Yes,72483,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,https://www.gouv.ci/doc/presse/1477497207RAPPORT%20FINAL_CDVR.pdf https://www.mcgill.ca/humanrights/files/humanrights/monteiro_eva_ihrip_v8_2020.pdf,2014,Yes,The Government of Côte d’Ivoire issued it in a press release.

161,790,0,The Commission of Inquiry to Find the Persons Disappeared during the Panchayat Period,पञ्चायत अवधिमा बेपत्ता भएका व्यक्तिहरूको खोजी गर्न छानबिन आयोग (The Commission of Inquiry to Find the Persons Disappeared during the Panchayat Period),"Panchayat was a period of totalitarianism initiated by King Mahendra in 1961 by removing the power of the Nepali Congress (NC) government in a sweeping abuse of his emergency powers. He claimed that Congress had become corrupt, beholden to political parties working against national interest, and failed to maintain law. Mahendra arrested prominent political figures, including the Prime Minister, banned political parties, limited civil liberties, curtailed freedom of expression, and censored the press. The Panchayat system formalized in the 1962 Constitution maintained some guise of elected representation through a four-tiered executive: the village, town, district, and national Panchayat. A certain number of representatives from each level were chosen by the next level to act as an electoral college, thus watering down genuine democratic representation and creating an incentive structure in which representatives sought to please those powerful in the level above them, and ultimately, the monarchy, rather than their electorate. The top elected body, the national Panchayat, was not allowed to criticize the decisions of the royal government or enact any bill without the approval of the King. Mahendra further consolidated power within the monarchy by “guiding” elected representatives through appointed administrative committees. By the 1980s, Nepal had undergone a rapid process of industrialization. Nepalese citizens expressed that they expected some civil and political liberalization along with economic liberalization, beginning to conduct more organized displays of dissent. There was widespread agreement that the royal government did not act in the interest of the masses, especially as it became clear that representatives aligned with the monarchy were embezzling and systematic human rights violations surfaced to the public eye. Economic prosperity became strained 1987-89, during which India-Nepal trade relations soured; the opposition seized this moment of insecurity and generalized discontent toward the monarchy to launch a movement in support of the NC. The People’s Movement was supported domestically and internationally, and by April 1990, a royal proclamation formally ended the Panchayat system and legalized political parties. The People installed an interim cabinet and Prime Minister, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai. Eager to distance himself from the Panchayat regime and legitimize his new government, Prime Minsiter Prasad Bhattarai immediately established two Commissions of Inquiry pursuant to the COI Act 2026, enacted 4 September 1969. The first, known as the Mallik Commission, was an event-specific investigation into repression during the Jana Andolan protests. This COI found that 45 people were killed and 23,000 injured during the 50-day movement. The second, the Commission of Inquiry to Find the Persons Disappeared during the Panchayat Period, was promulgated 31 July 1990 to investigate generalized human rights violations with a focus on disappearances during the totalitarian period 1961-90. It was additionally mandated to locate the detention centers and clandestine graves of the disappeared. Despite the broader powers outlined in the COI Act 2026, this COI had very limited powers. It lacked investigative teeth entirely; it could not summon testimony or subpoena documents and was entirely reliant on police cooperation. Initally, The COI initially was entirely biased—the mandate referenced the discredited 1962 Constitution and the chair was a collaborator with the monarchy who benefited from the Panchayat system, prompting two other commissions, both representatives of human rights groups, to resign. However, after civil society outrage, the initial COI was dissolved and its structure was adapted to be more independent and impartial. The commissioners were credible and included human rights organization representatives. Nonetheless, sources report that the COI was largely a political tool to legitimize the interim government of Prime Minister Prasad Bhattarai. Since he sought to distance himself from the former regime and ingratiate himself with the interest groups that supported the People’s Movement, this may not have totally compromised the COI’s work—that is, the COI was not biased in favor of the former regime. However, this does not mean that the COI was totally independent, either. The COI generally failed to conduct meaningful work. The police were overall unresponsive to the COI’s requests, thereby seriously hindering the COI’s overall investigation. In total, the COI inquired into 100 cases, but was only able to identify 35 cases of enforced disappearance—the remaining 65 persons went missing under “unknown” circumstances. The COI was not empowered to name perpetrators, and although it did note that “gross violations of human rights” had been perpetrated, it did not make any findings about responsibility and failed to specify the circumstances of these violations. No alleged perpetrators were held accountable as a result of the COI’s work. Its two-volume final report was submitted to the Prime Minister in 1991. In the years following the report’s submission, Amnesty International partnered with local civil society to lobby the government for the release of the report. It was finally released to the public in 1994. Nonetheless, no copies are immediately accessible—journalists and human rights organizations were not allowed to reproduce the report, which is only available through the parliamentary secretariat and Nepal’s national library.

147,91,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Comisión de la Verdad y la Reconciliación (Truth and Reconciliation Commission),"President Manuel Zelaya was sworn in as president in 2006 on a conservative platform. However, he reoriented his policy to the left during his term, implementing a liberal agenda in line with the Chávez-led Venezuelan regional initiative Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA). This included widespread socioeconomic equality programs, nationalization, including of the media, and increased subsidies, angering his business elite electorate. Political opposition against him grew with corruption charges on his administration and crystallized into a plan to depose him when he announced a national referendum to change the 1982 Honduran constitution. The Supreme Court effectively declared the referendum unconstitutional, which Zelaya ignored, demanding that the military (which assists with elections in Honduras) carry out the referendum. When the chief of the military, Vásquez, refused to do so, Zelaya dismissed him, prompting Congress to coalign against Zelaya with a no-confidence vote. It has now been revealed that Zelaya did not dismiss Vásquez, only threatened to do so. The Supreme Court then issued an order to the military to detain Zelaya, which led to his forced deportation to Costa Rica on June 28, 2009. Congress applauded the military actions and imposed interim President Roberto Micheletti, who was accused of human rights violations and corruption, in addition to rising crime and poverty. The OAS, US, and UN all condemned these events, recognizing the deposition as a coup. Honduras held elections in 2009 and elected President Porfirio Lobo Sosa, a member of the ruling party. After being sworn in in January 2010, he enacted Decreto Ejecutivo No. 002-2010 of February 2, 2010, an amnesty law for all those involved in the coup. On April 13, 2010, however, he also enacted Decreto Ejecutivo PCM 11-2010, which created la Comisión de la Verdad y la Reconciliación (Truth and Reconciliation Commission). The TRC was immediately criticized because there was absolutely no mention of human rights in its mandate; rather than investigating a patter of crimes of abuse, it investigated the “political crisis and social life” “before and after” the coup on June 28, 2009. This vagueness led critics to believe that the TRC was a means for President Lobo to whitewash the events of the coup and legitimize his presidency. This opinion was only supported by the fact that of the 5 commissioners, only 2 were citizens of Honduras and none had significant backgrounds in human rights. The TRC’s most outspoken critics, mostly victims groups and civil society, went so far as to establish an alternative commission, la Comisión de Verdad (the Truth Commission), led by famous human rights defenders, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo Perez Esquivel. However, the TRC’s report defies many of these criticisms. Not only did the TRC subvert its mandate and include information about human rights violations, but it also concluded that the actions of Congress and the military in deposing Zelaya constituted a coup, hence supporting the opposition’s narrative rather than Lobo’s narrative. It also found that the police and military had obstructed justice in both of these previous findings. While its information about human rights is not comprehensive, this can be blamed on the limitations placed on the TRC by the mandate and the cases it does mention are well-detailed. It claimed that the disproportionate use of force by the military and police during the coup and Micheletti’s interim government resulted in human rights violations expressed in extrajudicial executions, illegal deprivation of liberty, torture, sexual violations, political persecution and violations of freedom of expression. The report also mentions that the TRC collected approximately 50,000 sheets of documentation including 37 interviews with main protagonists, 250 interviews with victims of human rights violations, 180 interviews with key actors, and the transcripts of 125 public collective meetings in 18 departments, where the report estimates that 2,000 individuals participated. Unfortunately, however, the mandate specifies that these archives are not available for public consumption; the TRC compiled them for confidential safekeeping by an international mediator for 10 years before they could be released to the National Library of Honduras. Now that the 10 years has expired, it is unclear whether the archives are within the National Library of Honduras and, if so, whether they can be publicly accessed. The report also makes 88 recommendations in 8 areas: constitutional reform, institutional reform, human rights, rule of law, electoral politics, corruption, media, international politics, and politics of memory. However, both the report and the recommendations were largely ignored by President Lobo, although they were recognized and reproduced by the OAS. It is also notable that former President Zelaya’s wife, Xiomara Castro de Zelaya, was inaugurated as the first female president of Honduras in January 2022.",hybrid,domestic law,President Porfirio Lobo Sosa,,,2010,2010-04-13,<https://www.usip.org/publications/2012/02/truth-commission-honduras-2010>,completed,0,2010,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Unknown,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40,<https://www.usip.org/publications/2012/02/truth-commission-honduras-2010>,partially independent,Yes,5,The mandate states that the commissioners are of “renowned honorability and impartiality… two of the commissioners will be citizens of Honduras and three of the commissioners will be invited from other countries.

200,551,0,The Human Rights Commission of Inquiry (Munyama Commission),The Human Rights Commission of Inquiry (Munyama Commission),"After Rhodesia gained independence from the British in 1963, changing its name to Zambia. Despite its material wealth, it struggled after independence. In 1964, the United National Independence Party (UNIP) won parliamentary elections, ushering in the ‘Second Republic’. Subsequently, Kenneth Kaunda was elected Prime Minister, and implemented a policy of African Socialism including central planning and nationalization. In 1968, he was reelected. In the next few years, Zambia converted into what the 1973 constitution called “one-party participatory democracy”; membership in the UNIP was mandatory, other parties were banned, and all policy was created by an elite group of UNIP officials known as the ‘Committee’. Kaunda was reelected by UNIP officials as President repeatedly until 1988. During the 1970s and 80s, Zambia’s economy declined with a drop in the price of copper, prompting high state debt and, ultimately, a structural adjustment loan from the IMF. At this point, state repression was at a high. Arbitrary arrests, torture, and state sanctioned killing were commonplace among the above violations of civil and political rights. Employees in the natural resource extraction sector, including copper, went on strike in response to poor conditions and high cost of living, led by several union leaders including Frederick Chiluba. The state heavily repressed these protests and arrested Chiluba and others. In 1986 and 87, protests were constant almost the entire year. In 1990, security forces violently responded to riots prompted by the high cost of food, killing over 30. Afterwards, the state owned radio station reported that Kaunda had been removed from office by the army in a coup. This coup was unsuccessful, but Kaunda did recognize the need for reform and announced multiparty elections. Quickly, 11 parties formed, among them the Multiparty Movement for Democracy (MMD) led by Chiluba. A new constitution was drafted, and in 1991 the MMD won elections on a platform of upholding human rights, beginning the ‘Third Republic’. And yet, there were allegations that abuses were ongoing under the MMD. To legitimize the new regime and address the past, Chiluba established the Human Rights Commission of Inquiry on May 5, 1993. The Commission was chaired by Lusaka lawyer Bruce Munyama, its common namesake. The Munyama commission began work in June 1993. Its mandate was originally exclusive to the Second Republic, 1972-1991, but in response to internal and international pressure, the MMD government was forced to widen the remit to include abuses committed by its own ongoing Third Republic. The Commission was given extensive powers, including the power to summon testimony and subpoena documents. Because the Commission worked closely with the police, the threat of arrest behind its summons and subpoenas was also very real. Munyama repeatedly threatened to arrest government officers who refused to testify. As a result, it won the public’s confidence. The U.S. Dept. of State Country Report on Zambia in 1996 reported that the Munyama Commission “aggressively examined police human rights abuses in public hearings held in the first half of the year. These hearings not only brought to light numerous abuses, but they also forced police officers to account for their behavior in sworn testimony.” It heard testimony across the country, and investigated detention facilities and conditions in depth, where it found prisoners “suffering from malnutrition, tuberculosis, scabies, and dysentery. Some were said to be suffering from AIDS-related diseases.” The Commission’s final report suggested that close to 1,000 people had been detained under preservation of public security regulations between 1972 and 1993 in spite of the existence of a Bill of Rights.” Further, it “established that torture, abuses and human rights violations were not only perpetrated by the Zambian police in the past but continue to be practised currently.” Munyama revealed secret torture and detention facilities across the country, documenting the terrible conditions at these and other, above-board facilities, where prisoners were denied basic necessities like soap, clothing, food, and medical treatment. The final report was published in 1995. The Commission recommended comprehensive prison, police, and detainment facility reforms in addition to limited human rights reforms including the establishment of a permanent human rights commission. According to the Commission’s mandate, the government was obliged to issue a white paper in response to the final report and its recommendations, detailing how it would implement them. Accompanying this white paper, the government was also supposed to release the contents of the report. While the government issued the white paper in October 1996, it never released the final report. Miles Larmer claims that this is because the Munyama overstepped his original mandate and investigated abuses under the new government in addition to UNIP abuses. Anxious that the report would tarnish the reputation of the new regime, President Chiluba concealed it. Excerpts of the final report were leaked in the Zambia Post in January 1996, but the Post’s website has since been taken down. Nonetheless, some of the recommendations were enacted. In 1994, a new Inspector General of Police was implemented and immediately implemented discipline reforms. A new police training camp was opened, and human rights curriculum was introduced. In the same year, 230 middle ranking officers were enrolled in district human rights training, 33 officers were investigated for human rights-related misconduct, and 3 were sentenced to prison for criminal offenses. In 1996, a permanent Human Rights Commission was established.",domestic,domestic law,President Frederick Chiluba,,,1993,1993-05-05,,completed,0,1993,,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,no,yes,0,1,1,Yes,1972-1991 [Second Republic] and after 30 October 1991 until the establishment of the Commission [Third Republic],1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,<https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Zambia.htm>,fully independent,Yes,7,Appointed by President Chiluba.,No,No,,,<https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Zambia.htm> <https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/3030/1/Larmer_What(2006).pdf> <https://www.eisa.org/wep/zamagency1.htm>,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Zambia.htm>,Yes,982,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Unknown,No,http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/1289,1995,Yes,The Commission handed its report directly to the President Chiluba.,No,,,,Yes,0,,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,,<https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6aa3e10.html> <http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/1289> <https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/3030/1/Larmer_What(2006).pdf> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afr630011996en.pdf> <https://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/z/zambia/zambia977.pdf>,Yes,<http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/1289> <https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6aa3e10.html> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afr630011996en.pdf>,"“EISA Zambia: Human Rights Commission.” Accessed August 6, 2022. https://www.eisa.org/wep/zamagency1.htm.

189,800,0,Truth for Reconciliation Commission of Thailand,คณะกรรมการตรวจสอบและค้นหาความจริงเพื่อการปรองดอง (Truth for Reconciliation Commission of Thailand),"In 2006, the Royal Army staged a military coup against the “caretaker” government of Prime Minister Thaksin Sinawatra after a year-long political crisis centered around the uncomfortable tensions between Thaksin and the monarchy. The military declared martial law, cancelled elections, dissolved parliament, banned protests and all political activities, censored the media, and generally contributed to a climate of fear and repression. In 2007, the military held tightly controlled and not entirely free elections, preventing Shinawastra’s party members and allies from candidacy. In 2008, parliament was restored, but tensions continued between the People’s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), an ultraroyalist political movement that had begun in reaction to Thaksin’s government, and the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), the so-called “red shirts”, who aligned themselves with Thaksin’s former party. In 2009, Thaksin addressed the UDD, alleging that a high-ranking General in the military-monarchy nexus had orchestrated the coup and had conspired with members of the ""Ammatayathipatai,” or aristocratic elite overlords. He also alleged that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva had collaborated with the military-monarchy nexus in order to secure his seat in power, directing UDD anger toward Abhisit for ignoring obvious social issues and prolifically censoring the media. Thaksin called for a “people’s revolution,” prompting small-scale UDD protests and police-protestor or military-protestor violence. The UDD announced that they would conduct large-scale protests in March 2010 to call for election. This created an environment of mounting anticipation, prompting pro-government elements to threaten UDD members in the street, Abhisit to increase security and call out the Royal Army in advance, and the Royal Army to establish checkpoints to guarantee that UDD demonstrators were not carrying weapons. The protests began peacefully, but as the weeks continued, turnout and violence grew from all sides. Dozens of bombs were planted at Abhisit’s party’s headquarters, released into the crowd of protestors, and released into the crowd of soldiers. Pro-government citizens drove cars straight into the crowd of protestors. On April 8, Abhisit declared a state of emergency, and throughout April, protestors became violent, resulting in 92 dead and over 2,000 injured. The violence was exacerbated by mysterious “men in black” who attacked security forces. It remains completely unclear whether they were UDD in disguise, Thaksin’s men, or Abhisit’s men provoking the security forces. Throughout 2010, political tensions remained high but protests largely subsided. On June 8, 2010, Abhisit issued the Regulation of the Office of the Prime Minister on the Truth for National Reconciliation B.E. 2553, creating the Truth for Reconciliation Commission of Thailand. It is important to note that the TRCT was a truth for reconciliation, not a truth and reconciliation commission, meaning that its main purpose was facilitate future reconciliation through an objective understanding of the events and dialogue between stakeholders. It had no powers to summon or subpoena or even access official documents. These slim powers were a huge obstacle for the TRCT, because government agencies were unwilling to provide access to files, witnesses were fearful to testify without witness protection, and generally, the public’s distrust for the TRCT was not helped by its impotency. Almost no new truths emanated from the TRCT. Nonetheless, it received 1,643 testimonies, coordinated 33 public forums where multi-sector stakeholders aired grievances, and listed 1,766 cases of civilian fatality or serious injury eligible for reparation. In addition, it found 24,021 cases of medical need, 68,928 cases of mental or psychological need, and 3,096 cases of business operators who lost property, income, or opportunity in relation to the protest violence. Its findings are also rather extensive, which came as a surprise to many international and national organizations that alleged that the TRCT was not sufficiently independent. Located within the Ministry of Justice under the Prime Minister, the TRCT was Chaired by Kanit Nanakorn, who appointed the remaining 8 commissioners. Critics claimed that this set up a power dynamic wherein Chair Nanakorn was expected to appoint commissioners in line with the “official” narrative of the state. However, based on the final report, the commissioners took their job seriously and impartially. The TRCT finds all groups responsible for the violence, stating that “all parties involved must accept some degree of responsibility. Every party; whether the government, the opposition, political parties, leaders of the demonstrations, security agencies, or the media; should review their role and actions in the events.” It finds that protests were nonviolent until April 10, when they were violent on a very small-scale using teargas and homemade makeshift weapons until the men in black attacked soldiers with hand grenades and combat rifles. The report finds that the nail in the coffin was the protestors using blockades to block the Army’s exit. It points to bystander victims—journalists and medical professionals who were attacked by both protestors and security forces, and business owners whose property was destroyed, especially by tire fires that the protest used as blockades. It also finds that the protestors were treated unfairly in subsequent legal proceedings. The TRCT does, however, defend the emergency legislation that suspended constitutional guarantees and made it possible for the Royal army to use military-grade weaponry on protestors, pointing to all of the parts of the legislation that align with international humanitarian law. Finally, the TRCT makes hundreds of recommendations—although very few of them are actionable. Most are very vague and were never implemented, with the notable exception of reparations. In 2010, legislation was passed to issue 7.75 million baht for each death related to political violence from 2005-2010. This was later retracted when the National Anti-Corruption Commission determined that the compensation had no legal foundation.",domestic,domestic law,Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva,,,2010,2010-06-08,excerpts included in the final report at <http://library.nhrc.or.th/ulib/document/Fulltext/F07939.pdf>,completed,0,2010,<http://library.nhrc.or.th/ulib/document/Fulltext/F07939.pdf>,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,April and May 2010,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1766,<http://library.nhrc.or.th/ulib/document/Fulltext/F07939.pdf>,partially independent,Yes,9,"Chairman Kanit Nanakorn was appointed by the Prime Minister in consultation with the cabinet in Regulation B.E. 2553.

148,750,0,The Shah Commission of Inquiry,The Shah Commission of Inquiry,"On June 25, 1975, President Ali Ahmed, upon the advice of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, issued a Proclamation of Emergency that enabled Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to rule by decree and suspend fundamental constitutional guarantees for 21 months due to ‘internal disturbances’. Until March 21, 1977, India witnessed violations of civil and political rights, including the suspension of courts’ power to protect constitutional rights, the suspension of elections, the censorship of the press, attacks on journalists, political dissidents, educated intellectuals, and marginalized communities, and a comprehensive purge of impoverished neighborhoods and ‘slums’, resulting in widespread homelessness and displacement. It also included a “family planning” component that included the forced sterilization of the poor. In 1977, facing increasing domestic and international pressure, Gandhi called for elections, allegedly expecting that she would win another term. However, she suffered defeat by the Janata Party, which, almost immediately upon coming into office, created a COI to investigate the events preceding and during the state of emergency enacted by the Proclamation of June 25, 1975. The power of the government to create a COI was enshrined in the Commission of Inquiry Act of 1952, but the Shah COI was not actually established until a Ministry of Home Affairs notification appointing the COI on May 28, 1977. The COI was concerned with “excesses, malpractices and misdeeds” by state agents and systematically promoted by the state apparatus, including violence against journalists, the poor, and political opposition. In this way, it was largely centered around violations of civil and political rights. It had all of the powers of a civil court and was bound by the Rules of Civil Procedure in proceedings. It includes substantial due process guarantees, including right to legal counsel, right to cross-examination, and right to appeal. Interestingly, the COI was presided over by only one “commissioner,” Chairman J.C. Shah, a former Supreme Court Justice. Initially, the COI received 48,500 complaints, of which only 46,261 were taken under scrutiny. Of those, 8,432 were not covered by the COI’s mandate (although the 2,150 more serious violations contained in these unmandated cases were referred to state authorities for inquiry). Hence, the COI mandate covered 37,829 complaints. Only 2,342 of these complaints were kept for COI investigation; the others were sent to state authorities or departmental authorities. Only some of these cases were deemed appropriate for public hearing; 100 public hearings were held and recorded in 234 tapes now contained in the Ministry of Home Affairs archive. Particularly brutal or demonstrative cases are contained in the COI’s reports, which were released in installments. The first interim report deals with the events that precipitated the Proclamation of Emergency and exacerbated its effects. The second interim report discusses instances of repression, largely focusing on police misbehavior. The third interim report discusses prison conditions, torture, and the family planning atrocities. The COI found that Gandhi had fabricated the so-called economic emergency and crisis of law and order by which she justified the Proclamation of Emergency. It found that she abused the civil service and security sector to quash political dissent and subverted the rule of law. It also ruled that the Indian Administrative Service was partially at fault because the majority of its officers accepted orders despite knowing, and sometimes testifying, that they thought the orders were inappropriate and had political motives. While the final report makes no recommendations, it does make observations that function as recommendations. It held that a mechanism should be created to ensure that emergency laws are subjected to periodic review so that they are not misused by authorities; anti-fabrication efforts should be taken by the government to ensure that the states’ records’ integrity is preserved and cannot be used against citizens; an institution of oversight and evaluation of government officials; the government must guarantee political officials’ immunity and independence; the government must install safeguards to prevent the subversion of the administration during an emergency; the central and state governments should investigate those cases referred to them by the COI and prevent further cases of their kind; the government must better respect COIs by implementing their observations rather than ignoring them. Ironically, these observations were, in fact, ignored, and the COI was largely delegitimized by Prime Minister Gandhi, who returned to power via a free and fair election in 1980. She labeled the COI a smear campaign by her political opponents, the Janata Party.",domestic,domestic law,Parliament and the Ministry of Home Affairs,,,1977,1977-03-21,<http://library.bjp.org/jspui/handle/123456789/743>,completed,0,1977,<http://library.bjp.org/jspui/handle/123456789/743>,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,"The days immediately prior to and including June 25, 1975",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,2342,<http://library.bjp.org/jspui/handle/123456789/743>,fully independent,Yes,1,"Shah was named in the Act appointing the COI, presumably by merit according to his extensive legal background, but the metrics for choosing Shah in particular are not specified.",No,Yes,507,,<http://library.bjp.org/jspui/handle/123456789/743> <https://books.google.com/books?id=kyrzGM_2R7IC&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false>,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,<http://library.bjp.org/jspui/handle/123456789/743>,Yes,889,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,http://library.bjp.org/jspui/handle/123456789/743,1978,Yes,"The COI published its own report, which was released to the public and disseminated by the ruling Janata Party.

190,860,0,"Commission for Reception, Truth, and Reconciliation","Comissao de Acolhimento, Verdade e Reconciliacao de Timor-Leste (Commission for Reception, Truth, and Reconciliation)","East Timor remained a Portuguese colony until the fall of its military dictatorship in 1974 to a popular movement for democracy. After a small civil war due to political instability in the power vacuum left by the Portuguese, East Timor declared its independence. However, as it became increasingly apparent that the Timor government would be left-leaning, Indonesia, influenced by the Cold War politics of the decade, inaugurated Operation Komodo, which aimed to integrate East Timor into the Indonesian territory. Indonesia began with a propaganda campaign, but as it faced backlash and rejection, conflict developed into a full-on invasion, including militarized attacks against border security, naval attempts against large cities, and take-overs of small villages. Unsurprisingly, this was accompanied by deprivation of civilian rights and intentional violation of civilians as a weapon. While the UN condemned the invasion, no further action was taken due to tacit support from the US, who viewed the invasion as in furtherance of containment. Indonesia occupied East Timor December 1975-October 1999. During this period, Indonesia subjected pro-independence opposition to systematic torture, sexual slavery, extrajudicial killing, arbitrary detention, and intentional starvation. The Commission for Reception, Truth, and Reconciliation in East Timor estimates that 90,800 to 202,600 Timor people died out of a population of approximately 823,386. Several pro-independence paramilitaries (CNRT) kept the independence movement strong while simultaneously exacerbating the Indonesian’s justification for repression. In 1999, after the end of the Cold War, Indonesia bowed to internal and external political pressures and organized a referendum for independence. Despite this seemingly victorious moment, anti-independence paramilitaries undertook a final wave of violence, destroying most of the country’s infrastructure until Australia intervened, and the UN Security Council established the UN Transitional Administration (UNATET). UNTAET was a rare peacekeeping mission in which the UN directly administered the territory of East Timor to secure order, relief assistance, rehabilitate physical infrastructure, and draft a constitution in the absence of any Timorese law. In 2002, Timor-Leste officially became fully self-governing. Today, the actions of Indonesia in Timor-Leste are widely considered genocide. On 13 July 2001, UNTAET passed Regulation 2001/10, which created the Comissao de Acolhimento, Verdade e Reconciliacao de Timor-Leste (Commission for Reception, Truth, and Reconciliation). It had an all-encompassing mandate to seek truth about human rights violations committed April 1974-October 1999 while fostering reconciliation, apportioning responsibility, rehabilitating perpetrators into Timorese society, and making recommendations for non-recurrence and prevention of human rights violations. It was mandated for two years, with the possibility of a 6 month extension. It enjoyed wide powers to subpoena documents and summon testimony from individuals, although it could only request official and/or confidential documents from state agencies and foreign governments. CAVR could hold individuals that refused to comply with orders without reasonable excuse or were disruptive or interferring in contempt punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both. Additionally, it could request the District Court to issue a warrant for search and seizure should an individual fail to comply with a subpoena—however, it was at the District Court judge’s discretion as to whether or not there were reasonable grounds to believe that such a warrant would produce necessary evidence for CAVR’s inquiry. A warrant was by no means a guarantee. Nonetheless, CAVR was incredibly well-received by the public and enjoyed the cooperation and participation of the vast majority of society, including perpetrators. This success was facilitated by its size and capacity; it established 13 regional and district subcommissions, which helped to raise awareness of CAVR’s mandate and fostered trust in and local ownership of the process set forth by CAVR. In particular, the local subcommissions assisted with reconciliation processes. Low-level perpetrators who did not commit serious offenses but nonetheless committed criminal violations could confess to their wrongdoings and avoid criminal prosecution by undergoing a reconciliation process. The perp was required to fully confess in front of victims and other members of the public, who were then given the opportunity to ask questions and make comments. “Hearings were often an extremely emotional experience for the participants and could continue all day and into the night.” After commentary ended, the CAVR panel brokered an agreement in which the perpetrator consented to take certain reconciliatory actions, possibly including community service or reparations. Traditional practices were frequently incorporated. Should the perpetrator accept this reconciliation, they would be reaccepted into society. Should they refuse, they could be transferred to the General Prosecutor at CAVR’s discretion. Hence, this was more “akin to a negotiated plea bargain than a traditional amnesty.” This option was not available to perpetrators of serious offenses or those guilty of command responsibility. CAVR itself criticizes the continued impunity of the most responsible offenders, noting that while the communities it served were grateful for its services and appreciated the willingness of perpetrators that stood before them in acts of reconciliation, they were frustrated that those most responsible somehow remained out of reach of the formal justice system. Overall, CAVR was successful. It took a total of 8,775 testimonies, conducted a graveyard census, and held national and regional public hearings that were broadcast on TV and radio. It recognized 102,800-183,000 victims; 18,600 of which were killed or disappeared and 84,200 of which died due to starvation or illness. CAVR’s 2,800-page final report, Chega!, which means ‘enough’ or ‘no more’, was published in October 2005 with several other works, including 7 volumes of public hearings (according to theme), 3 additional volumes that focused on one perspective or event, and one video/radio documentary. All were publicly accessible on CAVR’s webite, at https://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en which is best viewed today on Wayback Machine at https://web.archive.org/web/20100202202556/http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/index.htm. CAVR’s publications were widely reproduced. Chega! made specific findings of responsibility, naming Indonesian General Wiranto, the Minister of Defense, and the Chief of the Armed Forces. It also set forward hundreds of recommendations, including those directed at the international community, Portugal, Timorese civil society, and the new Timorese parliament, security forces, judicial system, and education system.

154,660,0,Lebanese-Syrian Joint Commission on Disappearances,Lebanese-Syrian Joint Commission on Disappearances,"Lebanon is home to a significant number of ethnoreligious groups. Despite the presence of Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, and Druze, Christians were favored in politics due to the presence of a strong pro-Western Christian political elite reinforced by the French Mandate (1920-43). Many Muslims grew discontented with their lack of political representation and contributed to the growth of pan-Arabism, promoting left-wing politics in Lebanon. The influx of thousands of Palestinians after World War II constituted a demographic shift in favor of the Muslim population, and as Cold War politics took hold, Lebanon became polarized. Muslim populations increasingly supported the Soviets while the Christian political majority remained aligned with the West. In 1975, the nationalist Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) began fighting with Christian militias, prompting a rapid militarization of each political interest group, including pan-Arabist left-wing Lebanese National Movement (LNM). This signaled the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War. By 1976, Syria had intervened in support of the PLO, attempting to serve its own political and territorial interests, including rooting out Sunni cells and the anti-Ba’athist Muslim Brotherhood. The Arab League granted Syria permission to maintain its troops in Lebanon as an Arab Deterrent Force (ADF). In 1977, the ADF and Christian militia engaged in the Hundred Days War, after which the ADF was ordered to leave Lebanon. Lebanese forces increasingly attacked Israeli territory, prompting Israeli and US involvement in favor of the Christian majority. Paramilitary forces, political groups, split off factions, and foreign alliances shifted rapidly. In 1982, the US and UN stationed the Multinational Force in Lebanon to oversee the withdrawal of PLO and Syrian troops, but later that year, Iran got involved in the war, financing the creation of Hezbollah. Fighting did not ebb until the signing of the Tarif Agreement in 1989, even after which it continued in East Beirut. The US unfairly brokered tensions between Israel, Syria, and Lebanon, driven by its own alliances and interests in the Gulf War to act preferentially toward Israel and Syria. Overall, during the civil war, 17,415 Lebanese disappeared or were abducted by the various militant groups. According to Amnesty International, the Lebanese officials have ""generally failed to protect mass graves and to conduct exhumations from the civil war period.” In 1991, Lebanon enacted Law No. 84, which imposed blanket amnesty on political crimes during the civil war. The families of the disappeared nonetheless were very active in demanding investigations into their relatives. The Committee of the Families of the Kidnapped and Disappeared in Lebanon (CFKDL) conducted advocacy demanding that the government locate the bodies or at least acknowledge the disappeared. It organized sit-ins, protests, outreach to international human rights organizations, lobbying, and public awareness campaigns that can largely be credited for forcing the Lebanese government to acknowledge the disappeared. In January 2000, civil society and the families’ efforts paid off with the establishment of two Commissions of Investigation into the Fate of the Abducted and Disappeared Persons in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Both of these COIs failed to produce reports and generated nearly no new information. In 2003-05, there were a number of mass graves discovered in Syria and in Lebanon. Several of these graves were discovered by civilians, who, in some cases, stumbled upon literal bags of bones. In most of these cases, the authorities were alerted, arrived, and gaslit the civilians, alleging either that the graves were empty, that the bones were animal, or even destroying the forensic evidence. This put new vigor into the CFKDL movement, calling the attention of the UN and other international human rights organizations with a sit-in in front of the Beirut UN building. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began discussing a joint Commission, and on June 22, 2005, enacted Decree No. 43/2005, which created this Commission. Initially, it was only given 3 months. The Lebanese Center for Human Rights states that “the Joint Lebanese-Syrian Commission [was] not a genuine inquiry commission. The Lebanese… [did] not lead any investigation. It merely transmit[ed] to the Syrian half the list of names, and for some of the disappeared it provide[d] documents certifying their existence in Syria. The Syrian half of the Commission… investigat[ed] these individuals and [made] a determination as to whether they are still in detention in its prisons. The fate of those individuals thus depends on the goodwill of those who had been holding them in detention, incommunicado, for years.” Since the Lebanese commissioners were all security forces officers or public officials, and their Syrian counterparts were all state authorities, the Commission was not independent. In general, the Syrian officials refused to cooperate with Lebanese requests. They consistently claimed that names of the disappeared submitted by Lebanese commissioners had never been detained in Syria in contradiction with communiques released years prior by Syrian authorities stating that Syria had detained, convicted, and/or sentenced those individuals. According to Support of Lebanese in Detention and Exile (SOLIDE), “the absolute inefficiency of the commissions has in fact heightened the feeling of helplessness of the families.” In June 2009, the Ministry of Justice received news from the Commission that its Syrian elements had secured the release of 23 Lebanese disappeared persons detained in Syria through a special amnesty. Due to the resistance of the Syrian commissioners to reciprocate truthful information to the Lebanese commissioners, as well as the lack of testimony or actual investigative results, the Commission did not have much to report in spite of nearly 4 years of work. It released information about the 23 disappeared persons who received special amnesty from Syrian officials and dissolved itself. Immediately after, human rights organizations including CFKDL and SOLIDE released statements condemning the Commission, noting that none of the 23 Lebanese citizens that received special amnesty from Syria were victims of enforced disappearance. None of them appeared on the lists of these civil society organizations.",hybrid,domestic law,Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,,<https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/report/25724/lebanon-syria-lebanese-seek-lost-sons-and-daughters-syria>,2005,2005-06-22,,completed,0,2005,,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,1975-99,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,17415,<https://web.archive.org/web/20121204152740/http:/www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE18/001/2011/en/4c0716c2-8825-41d6-b816-c678ef4eeb44/mde180012011en.pdf> <https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http:/www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance_EN%202008.pdf> <http://www.actforthedisappeared.com/sites/default/files/Resource%20Documents/Article_LynnMaalouf_ENG_0.pdf>,not independent,Yes,3,Appointed by Prime Minister Najib Mikati in consultation with the Council of Ministers,No,Unknown,,,<http://www.cldh-lebanon.org/OurBlog/Artical/327?lang=en> <https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http:/www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance_EN%202008.pdf> <https://web.archive.org/web/20121204152740/http:/www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE18/001/2011/en/4c0716c2-8825-41d6-b816-c678ef4eeb44/mde180012011en.pdf> <https://www.akhbaralyawm.com/news/99305>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,No,,No,No,No,No,,,,2009,No,,No,,,,Unknown,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,<https://www.akhbaralyawm.com/news/99305>,No,<https://www.akhbaralyawm.com/news/99305>,"“Committee of the Families of the Kidnapped and Disappeared of Lebanon: Advocacy Case Study Analysis.” USAID, Beyond Group Consulting, November 2020. https://www.counterpart.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Case-Study-5_Committee-of-the-Families-of-the-Kidnapped-and-Disappeared.pdf. “Enforced Disappearances and Incommunicado Detentions.” Wayback Machine: Lebanese Center for Human Rights, February 21, 2008. https://web.archive.org/web/20130123232530/http://www.solida.org/Rapports%20et%20communiques/Rapports/english/CLDH%20Enforced%20Disappearance_EN%202008.pdf. “Never Forgotten: Lebanon’s Missing People.” Wayback Machine: Amnesty International, December 4, 2012. https://web.archive.org/web/20121204152740/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE18/001/2011/en/4c0716c2-8825-41d6-b816-c678ef4eeb44/mde180012011en.pdf.

134,130,0,Truth Commission to Impede Impunity,Comisión de la Verdad para Impedir la Impunidad (Truth Commission to Impede Impunity),"Ecuador returned from military to presidential rule in 1979, but a pattern of authoritarian human rights abuses continued. Between 1984 and 1988, President León Febres Cordero’s government led repressive campaigns against student and social movements that opposed his rule. Arbitrary detentions, torture, extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances were widespread. The initial Comisión de la Verdad y Justicia was established in 1996 by by President Abdala Bucaram to investigate the at least 176 reported cases of human rights abuses committed in Ecuador since 1979. However, this CVJ was unsuccessful for a myriad of reasons, including a lack of resources and unfulfilled promises from the Ecuadorian state. It officially severed ties with the Ecuadorian government and dissolved in February 1997 as popular discontentment with President Bucaram’s austerity intensified into a period of political turmoil, and ultimately, a legislative ousting that forced Bucaram to flee. It is in the context of political stability in the early 2000s that President Rafael Correa returned to the demands of victims’ groups to reignite the CVJ under a new mandate as la Comisión de la Verdad para Impedir la Impunidad. According to its mandate, Ministerial Accord No. 305 of May 3, 2007, the CVII was endowed with considerable power, including semi-judicial powers to compel access to confidential state and military documents, establish the responsibility of perpetrators, and ensure that those perpetrators are subject to proper legal proceedings within the judicial system. Additionally, it was intended to make reparations and institutional reform recommendations. The scope of the CVII was also very broad; while Ministerial Accord No. 305 established the time period of 1984-88 as a main focus, it also allowed the CVII to address exceptional scenarios of human rights abuse, such as the Fybeca case, in “other periods” up to its initiation in 2007. Like the previous CVJ, the CVII encountered many methodological and funding issues at the beginning of its mandate, resulting in the resignation of some staff. In order to guarantee quality work, President Correa extended the CVII’s mandate twice, once for 6 months in December 2008, and again for 3 months in June 2009. Its final report was submitted in September 2010 and presented at a public event attended by over a thousand Ecuadorians, including over 300 victims or children of victims. At the event, President Correa made a public apology to the victims and accepted state responsibility for their trauma and violation. The report was divided into 5 volumes that each tackled a different component of the investigative process. Overall, the CVII took more than 600 testimonies from victims and witnesses by setting up a private phone line and traveling to 17 provinces; reviewed more than 300,000 classified documents, mostly from the National Security Council, Ministry of Defense, and National Police; and found evidence of 831 human rights violations suffered by 456 victims. 44% of those 831 human rights violations were torture-related. The CVII concluded that most victims (167) suffered their violations in 1987, with a total of 68.7% of all violations occurring during the height of Cordero’s regime 1984-87. The 3rd volume of the final report is dedicated to naming each of the 456 victims and narrating the 831 cases of abuse with victims’ testimony. The 5th volume establishes the legal responsibility of 458 named perpetrators recommended for prosecution and makes 155 recommendations, generally distinguished into 5 categories: measures of satisfaction, measures of restitution, measures of rehabilitation, compensation, and guarantees of non-repetition. It offers a comprehensive section on reparations, including a draft bill proposed to the legislature including administrative programs and different dollar amounts for different violations.",domestic,domestic law,President Rafael Correa,,,2007,2007-05-03,https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/ROL/Mandato%20de%20Ecuador.pdf,completed,0,2007,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,yes,no,0,1,1,Yes,1984-88 and “other periods”,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,456,,fully independent,Yes,4,"According to Ministerial Accord No. 305, the commissioners have “recognized competence in the field of human rights and [are] of irreproachable moral character.”",Yes,Yes,63,1000000,"$1 million info is in the original airtable (not cited), but I can’t find it online",1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,<https://www.usip.org/publications/2007/05/truth-commission-ecuador-07>,Yes,600,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,,,,2009,Yes,"The CVII published its own report and presented it at an attended by over a thousand people, including 300 victims or children of victims.

227,790,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"सर्वाधिकार सुरक्षित (Commission of Inquiry for Enforced Disappearances, CIEDP)","The Nepalese Civil War began in 1996, when the Communist Party of Nepal launched an insurgency against the royal government with the explicit purpose of overthrowing the monarchy. During the civil war, more than 13,000 people died and 150,000 people fled conflict. Both sides perpetrated numerous violations of human rights during this time, including repression of journalists, suspension of civil and political rights, summary executions, forced disappearances, massacres, purges, and mass rapes. The civil war ended in 2006 with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, in which clause 5.2.5 stipulates the establishment of a TRC to ensure peaceful transition and coexistence. In the years after the Agreement (and until today), the government is a led by coalition of former Maoist rebels and the Marxist-Leninist Party, including many known perpetrators. This government made at least three aborted attempts at a TRC, in 2008, 2009, and 2013, each struck down by victims’ groups and civil society activism and/or litigation. The 2013 attempt resulted in a writ before the Supreme Court, in which the Court ruled that amnesties for crimes of international criminal law and gross violations of human rights are impermissible and enforced reconciliation is incompatible with the spirit of genuine reconciliation. Although victims’ groups and civil society were involved in the new drafting process following the 2013 Supreme Court ruling, three major parties quietly issued whips to force parliamentarians to withdraw other bills and vote instead for their bill, which ignored the directives from the Supreme Court. The final text of the bill was not released publicly or shared with victims’ groups or civil society, but signed into law as the Enforced Disappearances Inquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act on April 21, 2014. It established two commissions, one Commission of Inquiry for Enforced Disappearances and one TRC. The CIEDP was formed according to the decision of Nepal Government, Council of Ministers dated 27 Magh 2071 B.S. (10 February 2015). This commission is formed to seek truth on the cases of enforced disappearance, to recommend reparation to victims and prosecution to the accused ones. In the article 33 of interim Constitution of Nepal, 2007 and under the article 5.2.5 of Comprehensive Peace Accord held between Nepal Government and the contemporary Nepal Communist Party (Maoists) on 5 Mangsir 2063 B.S. (26 November 2006) have the provision of establishment of such commission. The commission investigates only the cases of disappearance related to armed conflict from 2051 Falgun 1 B.S. (13 February 1996) to 2063 Mangsir 5 B.S. (26 November 2006). OHCHR report, 2022: “In February 2020, the CIEDP announced to have performed detailed investigations into 2000 cases. However, the Commission would have merely called the families of the disappeared persons to verify a second time the facts in their initial complaints, rather than for other enquiries. On 4 February 2021, the government extended for an additional six months the mandate of the two commissions. The information received underscores, however, the ineffectiveness and the lack of independence of the commissions during the past six years, and the unlikeliness that they will efficiently contribute to expose the truth, guarantee access to justice and provide reparation to the victims, especially in the absence of a reform of the applicable legal framework and without ensuring a truly transparent and participative process. The sources argue that the mere extension of the mandate of transitional justice mechanisms “ and in particular the CIEDP “ without a genuine reform of the applicable legal framework and without ensuring a truly transparent and participative process, may hinder the victims’ rights and does not fulfil Nepal’s international human rights obligations.”",domestic,domestic law,Parliament,,"“Nepal: Stop Stalling Enforced Disappearance Inquiries.” Human Rights Watch.

170,360,0,"Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania, aka the Tismaneanu Commission","Comisiei Prezidenţiale pentru Analiza Dictaturii Comuniste din România, aka Comisiei Tismaneanu (Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania, aka the Tismaneanu Commission)","By the end of 1943, the USSR’s Red Army had occupied Nazi-allied Romania. An internal coup in 1944 led to the overthrow of the pro-Nazi government and installation of a pro-Soviet government. Romania signed an armistice with the USSR, essentially bequeathing its government and territory to Soviet control, and remained occupied until after the end of WWII. Repression under the USSR was long and varied, leading to competing narratives of the past. From 1945 to 1964, dictator Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej imposed Stalin’s will, imprisoning and killing many of the pre-communist elite, peasants who opposed forced collectivization, students and army officers who rejected the Red Army’s authority, and clergy who refused to renounce their faith. In this way, repression was ‘deep’. But when Nicolae Ceausescu became the country's new leader following Gheorghiu-Dej’s death in 1964, many previously unaffected populations felt the impact of ‘wide’ repression through the psychological effects of mass surveillance, food rationing, the destruction of cultural property and villages in forced systematization. Ceausescu created the Securitate, the secret political police, which collected information on and harassed intellectuals, religious figures, and political dissidents. The Securitate also initiated an informant recruitment system, which divided the already fractured society. A final competing narrative is the Revolution of 1989. The only country to exit communism via revolution, Romania experienced mass protests that turned violent. Interest groups blamed the initial mass shootings on opposing interest groups, and no closure has ever been established to this effect—who fired the first shots is still an open question. Post-communist Romania did not experience any break with the past or replacement of elites. Ion Iliescu, collaborator of Ceausescu, became President, and known communist dignitaries and secret agents filled the cabinet and legislature. Amnesty acts were implemented in 1988 and 1990, but some trials still occurred—notably, Ceausescu and his wife were sentenced to death during a trial that lasted only 2 hours. In the 1990s, the government conducted reparation, limited restitution, and recognition of some victims and massacred or ethnically discriminated villages. In 2005, the International Commission for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania completed its final report, which denounced Romania’s contribution in the Holocaust. The success of this commission led to the political will for a Soviet-violation-specific commission. A parliamentary commission (National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives) was established, but was unsuccessful, leading to the establishment of the Comisiei Prezidenţiale pentru Analiza Dictaturii Comuniste din România (Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania) in April 2006 by Presidential Decree. The Commission’s 18 commissioners were presided over by notable University of Maryland professor and political scientist Vladimir Tismaneanu, leading to the Commission being popularly called the Tismaneanu Commission. It had access to previously unavailable Communist Party and Securitate archives but did not take testimony or conduct any outreach. It was largely an academic, research-based commission. It was very inspired by the German parliamentary inquiry commission of 1992. The Commission faced significant criticism. Many commissioners had connections to the communist regime, leading skeptical politicians to question their moral authority to judge the actions of the USSR. Vladimir Tismaneanu’s family were members of the Community Party—his father was even named in the final report as a perpetrator. Commissioner Sorin Antohi was forced to resign after the Ministry of Education discovered that he never defended his doctoral thesis and the press revealed decades of fraudulent academic work. Antohi was expelled from his PhD program, listed nonexistent publications on his CV, and, in a published letter, admitted to having acted as an informant for the Securitate. Commissioner Nicolae Corneanu, an Orthodox bishop, also resigned due to his previous collaboration with the Securitate. Mihnea Berindei was accused of having cooperated with the Securitate, but categorically denied these accusations and did not resign. Its final report, submitted in December 2006, Final Report identifies 300,000 political victims of the USSR—5,000 executed during the great terror, 216,000 famine victims, 95,000 deportees to the gulag, and several thousand others convicted of “nationalism” or other political crimes. They explicitly address those workers who were recruited by the USSR, but they do not consider these individuals victims. The report explicitly names perpetrators, including many politicians in office at the time of publication. It identifies 21 main (types of or event-specific) criminal actions and recommendations in 5 broad categories: convictions, memorialization, legislation and justice, research and archives, and education. One highly controversial recommendation is for lustration of those perpetrators named in the report that still held office. On April 11, 2007, President Băsescu created the Presidential Advisory Commission for the Analysis of Communist Dictatorship in Romania to monitor the implementation of the original Commission’s recommendations. It was also chaired by Tismaneanu. “Only four of the twelve recommendations assumed by the president were implemented to date: presentation of the Final Report in the country’s major university centers, the publication of the history textbook on communist dictatorship, greater transparency of and access to the archives of communist regime, and the public recognition of the sufferings endured by the former political prisoners.” The Commission is often criticized for having minimal internal impact and “is often unjustly contested in Romania,” but its recommendations did spark dialogue. Even if they were unsuccessful, its recommendations, including memorialization efforts and the elephant in the room, lustration, were actively proposed as bills on the legislature floor.",hybrid,domestic law,President Traian Băsescu,,,2006,2006-04-01,,completed,0,2006,,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,1945-89,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,300000,<https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/article/RAPORT%20FINAL_%20CADCR.pdf>,partially independent,Yes,19,"?

165,385,0,"The commission to investigate the Norwegianisation policy and injustice against the Sámi and Kven/Norwegian Finnish peoples, aka the “Truth and Reconciliation Commission”","Kommisjonen for å granske fornorskingspolitikk og urett overfor samer, kvener og norskfinner, aka “Sannhets-og forsoningskommisjonen” (The commission to investigate the Norwegianisation policy and injustice against the Sámi and Kven/Norwegian Finnish peoples, aka the “Truth and Reconciliation Commission”)","In the periods up to the end of the 20th century, the Norwegian authorities pursued a policy towards the Sami, Kvens and Norwegian Finns that violated their civil, political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental rights and human dignity. This policy, commonly referred to as Norwegianisation, has had a lasting impact on the psychosocial development and political-economic inclusion of indigenous groups in Norway. This policy included “assimilation, dispossession of land and resources, legacy of residential schools, language and identity theft, forced conversion to Christianity, destruction and defamation of Sámi spirituality and sacred sites, and active engagement in racial biology research as recently as in the late 1960s in which Sámi were measured and categorized.” In recent years, the Sami have lobbied the Norwegian state for increased participation and self-determination, including achieving legislation that formed the Sami Parliament in 1989, the incorporation of indigenous rights into the Norwegian Constitution, and the ratification of human rights treaties and conventions regarding indigenous rights. With the Canadian TRC’s success in 2015, the Sami Parliament in Norway, as well as those in other Nordic countries like Finland and Sweden, began pushing for a TRC of their own. All three of these Sami Parliaments passed resolutions to this effect, prompting a resolution in the Norwegian Parliament, the Stortinget, on June 20, 2017. In this way, the TRC is not a post-authoritarian nor a post-conflict TC, rather an indigenous-specific post-atrocity TC. The commission to investigate the Norwegianisation policy and injustice against the Sámi and Kven/Norwegian Finnish peoples, aka the “Truth and Reconciliation Commission” began work in 2018 after the appointment of 12 commissioners in 2017 by the Stortinget. They are chaired by Dagfinn Høybråten, the former leader of the Norwegian Christian Democratic Party, and other members including researchers, political scientists, anthropologists, and minority specialists. However, many have criticized the TRC for lacking ethnic Sami commissioners. While members of the Secretariat are Sami, in many critics’ minds, this only reinforces the second-class status of Sami. Ultimately, the TRC is an expert commission that will advance conclusions geared toward academics. This is reflected in its work; while the TRC takes testimony, it encourages written or audio-recorded testimony, and largely holds conferences and roundtables with civil society and Sami leaders. By 2020, it had only taken 75 testimonies. The general Sami population has also found it difficult to trust the TRC due to their longstanding generational mistrust towards the Norwegian government. This has been exacerbated by the continued Nordic exclusion or only performative inclusion of Sami in trade deals regarding indigenous land, fishing territory, etc. One source refers to this as indigenous “backsliding” wherein the Nordic countries have agreed to protect indigenous rights de jure but fail to protect them de facto, and some Sami critics feel that reconciliation could be a means of legitimizing this backsliding by appearing to meet the psychosocial needs of Sami while continuing political and legal injustice. Further, the Sami have an expressed tendency to feel shame toward their mistreatment and defamation, especially regarding residential schools and other institutionalized practices of assimilation, causing some Sami civil society members to express concern that the TRC may not be able “to collect stories that are kept silent even within families,” and confusion about “how it will then recount them ‘from a Sami perspective’.” Those stories that are not even shared within the community are unlikely to be shared with a settler-established and -filled TRC unless serious outreach and trust-building is conducted. As established above, the TRC’s primary activities are outreach-oriented, but the turnout has not been high; only about 80 people on average. However, it has spurred some bottom-up indigenous initiatives, including memorialization efforts through art and culture exhibits in the capital Oslo. One unique element of the TRC is its institutional independence; the TRC is not subordinate to any government structure but rather a stand-alone institution that can, by issuing its own rules and regulations, alter its own mandate. For example, on May 9, 2019, the TRC commissioners chose to interpret their mandate as implicitly including the indigenous Finns. The TRC originally was supposed to complete its work by September 1, 2022, but extended its own mandate to June 1, 2023, when it will submit its final report to the Stortinget. At that time, the collected material will be handed over to the National Archives and will only be semi-public. Due to the private and personal nature of some of the material, “the archive after the commission must therefore be claused, and rules for access to it are prepared, so as to ensure that access is only given to researchers who work in accordance with established ethical guidelines and will safeguard individuals' demands for protection of their privacy in a satisfactory manner.”",domestic,domestic law,The Stortinget (Norwegian Parliament),,,2017,2017-06-20,<https://uit.no/kommisjonen/mandat>,ongoing,0,2018,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,yes,no,1,1,1,Yes,"It is important to note that this time period is flexible—the commission can reach further back into the past if it sees fit, however, the mandate states 1800-present",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,,<https://uit.no/kommisjonen/mandat_en> <https://brill.com/view/journals/ijgr/29/2/article-p205_001.xml> <https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12142-020-00594-x> <https://uit.no/kommisjonen/arrangementer>,fully independent,Yes,12,Appointed by the Stortinget.,Yes,Yes,7,,<https://uit.no/kommisjonen/sekretariatet_en> <https://uit.no/kommisjonen/medlemmer_en> <https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/43682-indigenous-peoples-norwegian-truth-commission-timid-first-steps.html>,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,<https://uit.no/kommisjonen/mandat>,Yes,75,No,No,Yes,No,,,https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/43682-indigenous-peoples-norwegian-truth-commission-timid-first-steps.html,,No,,,,,,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,No,<https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12142-020-00594-x>,"Sámi girkoráđđi - Sáme girkoráde - Saemien gærhkoeraerie - Samisk kirkeråd. “Conference- Reconciliation without the majority?” Accessed July 11, 2022. https://kirken.no/nb-NO/om-kirken/slik-styres-kirken/samisk-kirkeliv/Diakoni/forsoningskonferanse%202022/program%20-%20english/.

177,560,0,"The Commission of Inquiry into Certain Alleged Murders, aka the Harms Commission of Inquiry","The Commission of Inquiry into Certain Alleged Murders, aka the Harms Commission of Inquiry","In November 1989, Butana Almond Nofomela caused a scandal when he alleged on death row that he was a part of one of five death squads operating out of Vlakplaas farm. He claimed that he had participated in the brutal killing of anti-apartheid activist Griffiths Mxenge and had witnessed countless other killings. His claims were corroborated by his former commanding officer, Dirk Coetzee, and by David Tshikalange, another former officer. President Frederik Willem de Klerk denied these allegations and established a Commission of Inquiry (the McNally Commission), which found the allegations to be baseless within a month. Pressures continued to mount, however, both from within South Africa as well as from international human rights organizations. These pressures were exacerbated in early 1990, when it was revealed that the South African Defense Forces (SADF) sponsored a clandestine death squad known as the Civil Cooperation Bureau. President Klerk felt compelled to establish the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Alleged Murders, to which he appointed Justice Louis Harms, the COI’s common namesake. The Harms Commission was neither a post-authoritarian or post-conflict TC per se because democratic transition had not yet consolidated and the South African conflict was never considered a civil war, although it meets the quantitative definition. It was more of the later than the former, but more than anything else, it was a post-atrocity TC. The Harms Commission was established Febrary 9, 1990 and worked for 6 months, submitting its final report in November 1990. It was effectively a puppet institution of the state that was intended to advance evidence only for the “official” regime narrative that death squads were unactive. It has been widely criticized by international organizations as a “whitewash”. The Harms Commission terms of reference were exceedingly narrow, specific only to politically-motivated “murders and other unlawful acts of violence,” committed within South African territory. The final report states that it is pointless to interpret the Commission’s terms of reference broadly, since their meaning is a matter of law justiciable in court, where they would be interpreted restrictively. Despite the fact that the Commission was created in the midst of public turmoil about the CCB, anti-apartheid activists deaths in neighboring countries, and international backlash about police brutality, the report specifies that it was not created “to investigate the security arm of the state, the so-called Civil Cooperation Bureau or, for that matter, the ANC or PAC; to investigate acts of violence which were not committed with the necessary political intent…; to investigate allegations of police brutality unaccompanied by the necessary political intent.” The Harms Commission also had very narrow powers—although it could summon testimony and subpoena documents, and thus had a superficial power to compel, it could not penalize individuals for non-compliance or hold disruptive individuals in contempt. Furthermore, witnesses before the Harms Commission had expansive privileges: they could refuse to testify in any matter which was “not a matter of public concern, does not fall squarely within the ambit of the terms of reference, [or] is irrelevant.” A few sources note that some witnesses wore disguises and wigs to hide their identity while testifying to their personal or professional benefit. Nothing that the Harms Commission did was public—there were no public hearings, none of the documents it received were reproduced publicly, and no testimony was public. The final report, however, was sold publicly. At the beginning of the Commission’s work, the Ministry of Justice issued it a list of 71 alleged unsolved politically inspired murders, the South African Police produced the names of 2,851 alleged victims of politically motivated murders, and the Board of Inquiry into Informal Repression provided a list of 42 murders, 7 disappearances, and 200 other violations. The Harms Commission did not establish responsibility for a single one of these violations. Beyond Coetzee, Tshiklanga, and Nofmela, three names already nationally renowned for whistleblowing, the Commission does not name any perpetrator names, even failing to establish institutional responsibility for violations. Despite the fact that witnesses repeatedly testified to the existence of the CCB, “the Commission has a serious problem about relying to any significant extent on any of the witnesses that gave evidence on the various internal projects of the CCB.” Harms claims that “it is normal for a defence force to establish and make use of a covert organization,” so the CCB’s existence is not prima facie a violation. Further, he argues that without SADF documentation about the CCB, it is simply impossible to verify that the CCB conducted any violent activity at all. He does, however, note that if the CCB did commit politically-motivated murders, the Minister of Defence would be responsible. When investigating the Vlakplaas hit squads, Harms repeatedly characterizes Coetzee, Tshiklanga, and Nofmela as perjurers who intentionally fabricated evidence. While Harms concedes that it is factually true that they had killed at Vlakplaas, he claims that it cannot be established by a preponderance of the evidence whether these killings were at the instruction of higher authority or were politically motivated. Harms acknowledges that violations have occurred but maintains that there was no evidence that “a particular policeman committed a particular crime of violence for a particular purpose.” He offers limited recommendations, namely that the SADF and police are more structurally divided, that both keep better records, and that the Attorney General investigate 9 cases in more depth. He concludes that “it lies beyond the powers of a commission to prevent violence.”",hybrid,domestic law,Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee and President Frederik Willem de Klerk,,,1990,1990-02-02,<http://historicalpapers-atom.wits.ac.za/report-of-harms-commission-2>,completed,0,1990,,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,no,no,0,1,0,,,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,not independent,Yes,1,President F.W.

176,560,0,"The Commission of Inquiry regarding the Prevention of Public Violence and Intimidation, aka the Goldstone Commission","The Commission of Inquiry regarding the Prevention of Public Violence and Intimidation, aka the Goldstone Commission","After considerable violence, scandals related to death squads sponsored by the South Africa Defense Forces (SADF), and international pressure, the end of apartheid in South Africa accelerated with the election of President Frederik Willem de Klerk. De Klerk made a series of unilateral moves toward negotiation, including freeing Nelson Mandela from prison and expanding political plurality by unbanning political parties, including the underground liberation movement African National Congress (ANC) and the ANC separatist party, the Inthaka Freedom Party (IFP) based in KwaZulu. This sudden expansion of formerly clandestine, or at least informal, political actors and spaces into legitimacy led to social disruption and violence during negotiations in 1990-1993. The ANC, which wielded greater political power, established the pre-conditions to negotiations, leading to the first agreement on the desirability of a multiparty settlement—an agreement about an agreement—the National Peace Accord, signed September 9, 1991. Chapter 6 of the Accord called for the establishment of a commission of inquiry to investigate “the phenomenon of public violence and intimidations” during the recent years and ongoing through the negotiations. On July 17, 1991, President de Klerk signed into law Act No. 139, which established the Commission of Inquiry regarding the Prevention of Public Violence and Intimidation. It was neither a post-authoritarian or post-conflict TC per se because democratic transition had not yet consolidated and the South African conflict was never considered a civil war, although it meets the quantitative definition. It was more of the later than the former, but more than anything else, it was a post-atrocity TC. It was composed of 5 hybrid commissioners led by Justice Richard Goldstone, the namesake for the Commission’s common name, the Goldstone Commission. It had powers to compel testimony and documentation, to search and seize without a warrant, and to hold individuals in criminal contempt corresponding to fine or imprisonment for failure to comply or intentional disruption. It was structurally different than previous South African COIs; simply put, it was more independent. Its vague mandate, with no reference to specific crimes, combined with its expansive powers, combined with its ability to set its own agenda along the investigative lines it deemed most important meant that the Goldstone Commission was not limited by any statutory document or subordinate to any power. It also had no time limit or period—it could suggest its own end date and investigated past violations and ongoing violations. Ultimately, the Commission conducted 467 investigations and produced 47 reports, including thematic- and event-specific reports as well as interim reports and a final report. Unlike the COIs before it, the Goldstone Commission readily acknowledged that human rights violations were committed by the South African Police (SAP) and the SADF, even confirming the existence of death squads and that the SAP and KwaZulu Police (KZP) traffic arms, commit terrorist acts, and are aligned with the various political factions in South Africa. One of the reports states “the fact that hit squads are operating in South Africa cannot seriously be doubted” after an inquiry into the SAP that revealed that KZP hit squad members had been trained by SADF. The revelation of the SADF’s involvement led to 23 top officials involved in violence to undermine Black opposition being fired by President de Klerk. This was particularly important because of the ongoing violence during negotiations. The multi-party Convention for. a Democratic South Africa (CODESA), the follow-up to the National Peace Accord, was caught in total deadlock regarding regional autonomy, political and cultural self-determination, and a new constitution. The Boipatong massacre in 1992 led the ANC to withdraw from negotiations entirely, while KwaZulu became a verifiable war zone as the ANC and IFP clashed, each establishing their own self-defense units and self-protection units, which were essentially private armies armed with weapons trafficked from allies in the KZP. Persistent political deaths by hit squads strengthened the allegations that there was a “third force” bent on destabilization. The threat of violence only grew with the drafting of the 1993 constitution, which led to separatist and right-wing groups storming the World Trade Center, and the first democratic elections in 1994, which the IFP boycotted. The Goldstone Commission conducted investigations into nearly every politically-motivated violent event in this 4-year period, and certainly all those listed above. One source notes that even if each of these investigations was not completely holistic, the investigations served as an immediate form of official acknowledgement, and the Goldstone Commission commanded considerable credibility because of its willingness to investigate politicized topics and the general public’s confidence that it would tell the truth and get results. In fact, the International Electoral Commission requested that the Goldstone Commission establish 12 subnational investigation units (in addition to an existing 5) during the election period March-June 1994 to monitor election violence. Several sources, and the Goldstone Commission’s final report, note that the Commission’s presence and preemptive investigations served to prevent violence on more than one occasion. The Commission could not attribute legal responsibility, but its collection of evidence was comprehensive. At the time of the final report’s writing, the shooting incidents in Johannesburg in March 1994, the criminal violence of the South African Police Force, the KwaZulu Police Force, and the Inkatha Police Force were actively being investigated by the Attorney General. Several other cases had been referred to the Attorney General and the Electoral Commission, as well. Two areas comprehensively investigated include taxi violence and the complicity of the SAP in the “taxi war” and the impact of violence on children, which resulted in the Children’s Charter of South Africa legislation in 1992.

166,770,0,"War Inquiry Commission, aka the Hamoodur Rahman Commission","الباكستانية جنة التحقيق الحرب (War Inquiry Commission, aka the Hamoodur Rahman Commission)","Pakistan’s evolution post-independence is incredibly complicated and marred by continuous conflict with India and military regimes. A monarchy under the British crown until 1956, democracy was further stalled by martial law under General Ayub Khan. After adopting a presidential system, Pakistan went almost immediately into a war with India that led to a degradation of living conditions and economic growth, prompting the reestablishment of martial law under General Yahya Khan in 1969. In 1970, Pakistan held its first democratic elections, but the East Pakistani Awami League won against the West Pakistani Pakistan People’s Party, Yahya Khan refused to hand over power to the elected government. This was largely due to ethnic tensions; East Pakistan, populated largely by ethnic Bengali and Bihari, was perceived as culturally inferior to West Pakistan. Also, the Awami League was supportive of the Bengali self-determination, language movement, and nationalist movement. Yahya Khan launched “Operation Searchlight” a military crackdown on Bengalis that included human rights violations. This prompted a full-blown war of liberation, supported by the Awami League and waged by the Mukti Bahini, a force composed of the modern-day Bangladesh military, paramilitaries, and local militias. Atrocities, including mass rape, pillaging, and mass burials, were committed by the Mukti Bahini against pro-Pakistani elements during March 1971, including East Pakistanis, pro-Pakistan East Bengalis, and ethnic Biharis, who maintained a pro-Pakistan stance despite remaining within Bengal territory—totaling around 100,000 to 500,000 people. In retaliation, the Pakistan Army committed even greater atrocities, including arson, pillaging, massacres, the use of mass graves, deliberate targeting of Bengali intellectuals and professionals, the Hindu minority, and East Pakistani civilians, including the disappearance of businessmen and industrialists and the orchestration of mass rape of women as an act of revenge. Today, these acts are considered a genocide. India joined the war in December 1971, which rapidly precipitated its end; India controlled the Pakistani air space and aided the Mukti Bahini in taking over the Eastern territory. Pakistan surrendered in Dacca on December 16, 1971. President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto replated Yahya Khan and established a War Inquiry Commission via the Ministry of Presidential Affairs Notification No. 632 (1)/71 on December 26, 1971. The Commission was popularly known as the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, named after the Chair of its 4 commissioners, Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman, who was himself from a Bengali family, although not ethnically Bengali. It had an interesting mandate; rather than focusing on human rights abuses that occurred during the conflict, the Commission was tasked with determining the conditions that precipitated the Pakistan Army to surrender. It began work in 1972 with the powers to summon, subpoena, and issue warrants to guarantee compliance. All of its proceedings were held in camera, but they were all considered “absolutely privileged” and were not archived available to the public. After receiving 213 testimonies, it submitted its first report at the end of 1972, delivering 12 copies of the report to executives and President Bhutto, but its conclusions were wholeheartedly rejected by the government. It claimed that no definitive lines of causation were drawn, that it was all “tentative,” and that the real truth could only be known if the POWs and Eastern Command officers in India were repatriated to Pakistan. In 1974, when the POWs and remaining officers were repatriated, President Bhutto reopened the Commission. Again, after receiving 72 testimonies, it completed its work within a year, but the government roundly rejected its conclusions. Bhutto went so far as to publicly announce that the reports were burned to “save its [the military’s] honor.” Obviously, this left no doubt in the minds of the general public as to the contents of the report—clearly, it had condemned military actions. Speculation refused to die, however, especially after one report was found in Bhutto’s house in 1979 after his execution. It remained confidential to the Ministry of Interior until suddenly, in 2000, the magazine India Today leaked the 1974 supplement to the 1972 report. This was clearly politically motivated; at the time, India was under severe domestic and international pressure due to the recent surge in violence against Kashmiri Muslims. Releasing the report was a diversion. It is still unclear how the document was obtained and its degree of credibility. However, many Pakistani scholars and former intelligencia confirmed the contents of the report, which aligned with compiled 1970s-era speculation, military memoirs, and family documents from former high-level military officers. Many considered the enraged reaction from the Pakistani Ministry of Interior and Military as a verifiable certification of the report’s genuineness. The Commission makes damning conclusions about the military. In reference to the conditions of surrender, it finds that this was due to the rise of corruption in the high ranks of command, where officers “had not only lost the will to fight, but also the professional competence” after years of martial law. It claims that the Pakistan Army had engaged in morally negligent conduct, including dispossessing civilians of land and abusing substances. While it makes no direct victim count, it does estimate March 1971 deaths as totaling around 100,000-500,000 and challenges Bangladesh authorities’ figure that 3 million Bengalis were killed and 200,000 women were raped. It puts the death toll as low as 26,000 and notes that the Bangladesh post-war abortion program only completed around 150 abortions. This is clearly skewed data in favor of Pakistan considering that the focus on March 1971 is before active Army engagement, not all rape results in pregnancy, and modern-day estimates of the wartime death toll by independent organizations average around 300,000-500,000. The US State Department conservatively estimates that at least 200,000 Bengalis were killed. Its recommendations are robust. It catalogs the crimes of 22 military members, all of which include conducting or orchestrating crimes against humanity, and recommends them for prosecution. That includes the following, emphasizing that “the final and overall responsibility must rest on General Yahya Khan, Lt. Gen. Pirazada, Maj Gen. Umar, Lt. Gen. Mitha… Maj. Gen. Mitha…Lt. Gen Tikka Khan, Major Gen. Farman Ali, Maj. Gen Khadim Hussain, [and] Lt. Gen. A.A.K.

173,345,0,"(Serbia and Montenegro) Truth and Reconciliation Commission for Serbia and Montenegro, aka the Yugoslav Truth and Reconciliation Commission","(Serbia and Montenegro) Komisija za istinu i pomirenje (Truth and Reconciliation Commission for Serbia and Montenegro, aka the Yugoslav Truth and Reconciliation Commission)","The Soviet Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) was established in 1918, federalizing an ethnic mix of Albanians, Bosnians, Croats, Kosovars, Montenegrins, Serbs, Slovenians and others. After longtime ruler Josef Broz Tito’s death in 1980, ethnic tensions began to rise and Yugoslavia started to disintegrate. Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević sought to restore pre-1974 Serbian sovereignty over the autonomous regions of Vojvodina and Kosovo. Multi-party elections in 1991 led to the secession wars of Croatia and Slovenia from the Yugoslav state in June 1991. After unification negotiations failed, Milošević proceeded to lead the predominantly Serbian army of Yugoslavia in a campaign of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia between 1991 and 1995. Bosnian and Croat forces also took part in wartime atrocities. The Dayton Peace Accords were brokered by the U.S. in November 1995 to stop the Yugoslav war(s), forming the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), composed of the territories of Serbia and Montenegro. The resulting parliamentary and municipal elections in 1996 were largely against Milošević, but he continued to control the parliament and security forces. In 1998, Milošević began concerted efforts to suppress the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo in the name of the Serbian minority. After additional monitoring and negotiation efforts failed, NATO led a military intervention in March 1999. When Serbian forces were defeated, Milošević lost power as president of the FRY, and was succeeded by Vojislav Kostunica. The International Criminal Tribunal for (the former) Yugoslavia was founded in 1993 to investigate crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, and crimes of aggression since 1991. On March 30, 2001, President Kostunica signed Decree 15/2001, establishing the Komisija za istinu i pomirenje (Truth and Reconciliation Commission for Serbia and Montenegro, aka the Yugoslav Truth and Reconciliation Commission). Many international observers were happy with this development, hoping that the Commission could serve as a complement to the ICTY, supplementing the ICTY’s attribution of individual criminal responsibility with a broader truth about the causes and consequences of conflict and the collective responsibility of society as a whole. Also, perhaps most notably, the ICTY was held in very low esteem in the FRY, where many Serbs claimed that it was “anti-Serb” and continued to deny responsibility even as their leaders were being prosecuted. International observers thus hoped that the Commission could clarify the truth about the genocide from inside the nation. Unfortunately, however, the Commission was a failure. In many ways, it was doomed from the start. Decree 15/2001 specifies almost nothing about the substantive investigative goals of the Commission, stating only its commissioners and generally outlining its purpose. The Commission’s Rules of Procedure and Basic Program both specify its powers and investigative authority differently. The clarity of its mandate is very much blurred by the fact there is no clear hierarchy between these conflicting documents, so there is no legal means to defend that the Commission is empowered either with the powers outlined in the Rules of Procedure—only to investigate through review—or in the Basic Program—through testimony, public hearings, and accessing state documents. That the Commission’s mandate is spelled out somewhat differently in three documents led to confusion, and even to the resignation of three of its 19 commissioners. The commissioners were all Serbian, with no representatives from Montenegro or other former Yugoslavian states, despite the fact that the Commission would pass judgement on these states’ wartime actions and that it was explicitly supposed to collaborate with these neighbors. The commissioners only include two ethnic groups—simply insufficient to navigate a conflict marked by multiple inter-ethnic conflicts each with narrow internal “truth” narratives. Civil society and victims felt that the Commission was under political pressure to produce a non-critical report. Resigning members not only complained of the Commission’s legal impotence, but also denounced the Commission’s apparent goal of diminishing Western pressure for ICTY compliance as “vulgar and counterproductive.” This points to President Kostunica’s two underlying political goals in establishing the Commission. On the one hand, to placate US and EU demands that he address the legacy of the Milošević era. On the other hand, to delay ICTY trials; the Commission was given three years to complete its work, during which time President Kostunica demanded that the ICTY postpone prosecutions to preserve the evidentiary status quo. However, Kostunica’s PM orchestrated a series of concessions to the Hague, allowing the ICTY to function in conjunction with the Commission. In the eyes of President Kostunica, this nullified one of the Commission’s two functions, prompting Kostunica to starve the Commission of funding, meeting only 1/5 ($20,000) of its requested budget. The Commission did not receive an office until the end of 2002 and never hired staff. It held one roundtable discussion that was poorly attended and rather irrelevant before it was disbanded. The lack of funding, political and social will, and mistrust by civil society and victims foreshadowed its dissolution. In 2003, constitutional reforms separated Serbia and Montenegro, dissolving the FRY. This also dissolved the office of the presidency, and with it, the Commission’s mandate was dissolved, too. In short, the Commission was over before it even started. Even if these external factors had not existed, there were other problems with its mandate. Its focus on the disintegration of the SFRY is a region-wide truth-seeking task—how is a national truth commission supposed to determine and assess the “truth” of six different states, about which each of those six states have differing views? How, for example, can the Serbs pass judgement on why Slovenia pushed for independence? This is certainly out of the purview of any national commission. In recent years, starting in 2018, the growth of a regional coalition for such a Balkan-wide Truth Commission (RECOM) may finally address this methodological truth-seeking problem.",domestic,domestic law,President Vojislav Koštunica,,,2001,2001-03-30,<https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Serbia&Motenegro-Charter.pdf>,completed,0,2002,,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,no,no,0,1,1,Yes,1980-2000,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,,<https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1809&context=ilj>,partially independent,Yes,15,Appointed by the President and named in Decree 15/2001 and 59/2002.,Yes,No,,20000,<https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1809&context=ilj> <https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-FormerYugoslavia-Serbia-Developments-2004-English_0.pdf>,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,<https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1809&context=ilj> excerpts from the draft Rules of Procedure and Basic Program,No,,No,No,No,No,,,,2003,No,,,,,,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,No,<https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-FormerYugoslavia-Serbia-Developments-2004-English_0.pdf> <https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1809&context=ilj>,"Freeman, Mark. “SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO: SELECTED DEVELOPMENTS IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE.” Case Study Series.

175,940,0,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"The Solomon Islands descended into ethnic violence between 1997 and 2003, referred to as “the Tensions”. Rival ethnic groups on the islands of Guadalcanal and Malaita competed for land rights, employment, and the distribution of public goods. Malaitian residents had been migrating to Guadalcanal for decades, attracted to the greater economic opportunities there, but native Guadalcanal residents were actively being displaced economically, socially, and physically by this influx. This prompted the establishment of the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM), a Guadalcanal revolutionary army that conducted a campaign of intimidation, terror, and violence against Malaitian settlers. Thousands of settlers fled back to Malaita and subsequently established the counterinsurgent Malaitian Eagle Force (MEF). The police played a key role in these groups’ violations of human rights; the security force was divided along ethnic lines and began arms trafficking to their respective ethnic allegiances. Finally, on October 15, 2000, the MEF, elements of the IFM, and the government signed the Townsville Peace Agreement. In February 2001, stakeholders who were not involved in the Townsville Agreement signed the additional Mauru Peace Agreement. Violence continued, however, because a leading militant refused to sign any agreement, splitting the IFM and moving conflict to the remote Weathercoast region of Guadalcanal. Meanwhile, militants supported by the police increasingly turned their attention to organized crime and extortion. Law and order collapsed completely. In 2003, the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) launched a military intervention that quelled the violence. In 2000 and 2001, while conflict was still ongoing, Parliament enacted widespread Amnesty Acts in an attempt to broker peace. In August 2008, Shemuel Sam Iduri, Minister for National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace, introduced a Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act to Parliament. It was very much modeled on the South Africa TRC, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu presided over its inauguration in April 2009. Like the South African TRC, the Solomon Island TRC used a theological model of reconciliation—Christian faith is one of the only common grounds shared by the Solomon Islands’ diverse ethnic population, so the TRC’s public face was very much Christian. A key difference with South Africa, however, is that the Amnesty Acts of 2000 and 2001 left the TRC with few incentives for perpetrators to testify. It was, however, empowered to compel testimony and the production of documents at the penalty of police involvement and contempt of court. Its hybrid organizational structure was composed of 3 national and 2 international commissioners and a large staff. It began holding public hearings in 2010, where it heard 242 testimonies, all of which were broadcast on the radio and several of which were televised. These public hearings are transcribed for review in the fifth volume of the TRC’s five-volume final report, submitted to the Prime Minister in 2012. In total, 2,362 statements were collected. The final report documents 5,721 cases of human rights violations: 200 killings, 212 abductions, 95 illegal detentions, 1,413 cases of torture, 63 cases of sexual violence, 1,856 cases of property violation, and 1,882 forcibly displaced families with a total displaced population of 11,292. The Exhumations and Victims Program conducted grave-mapping and exhumations of 146 victims. While the TRC completed a great deal during its mandate, it encountered significant difficulties that complicate this picture. The TRC was largely funded by external donors, namely the EU, Australia, New Zealand, and the UNDP. The Ministry for National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace (MNURP) administered the TRC and entered into an agreement with the UNDP that the UNDP would be responsible for the financial management of the TRC. The UNDP created its own branch of TRC staff—the International Support Facility (ISF)—and paid the salaries of other TRC staff. Most national staff was seconded from the MNURP, but all of this inter-organizational cooperation complicated ownership of the TRC; half its staff was directly subordinate to the UNDP, and the other half had largely been subordinate to the MNURP until they were abruptly transferred, so it was difficult for staff to know exactly where their allegiances should lie. Also, financial administration by the UNDP led to logistical issues. The UNDP oversaw $3,521,046 for a budget period ending in September 2011; the TRC began exhumations with an exhumation-specific budget of SBD$700,000 in August 2011. Abruptly, midway through exhumations, the UNDP-ISF period expired, and it stopped all operational funding despite the fact that only 18.6% of the exhumation-specific budget had been spent by the TRC. The Solomon Islands government stepped up to cover the last few exhumations with SBD$500,000. Ownership was also complicated by the fact that the international commissioners—experts in transitional justice, not the Solomon Islands—were the driving force behind most of the TRC’s activities, subsequently resulting in a lack of national or local ownership. This is relates to the largest problem with the Solomon Islands TRC: it lacked moral capital. Solomon Islanders interviewed claim that they associated the TRC’s rhetoric of human rights with individualism, which they construe as a threat to traditional authority and morality. The neglect and devaluation of traditional authority and morality is what most blame for the violence in the first place, so the TRC seemed counterproductive and counterintuitive to much of the population. Finally, while the TRC Act of 2008 included a provision for the public release of the report and establishment of a follow-up committee to monitor the implementation of recommendations, Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo refused to release the final report to the public. He claimed that it would reignite tensions. Considering this a violation of the public’s right to truth, Bishop Terry Brown, who was not a commissioner but was the final report’s editor, published the final report to the media in 2013. Specifically, all five volumes of the TRC report were published by a research think tank, the Pacific Institute of Public Policy. Brown also wrote several op-eds and articles about the TRC’s failures and the government’s ineptitude.",hybrid,domestic law,Parliament and Shemuel Sam Iduri,,,2008,2008-08-28,<http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/num_act/tarca2008371/>,completed,0,2009,,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,no,yes,1,1,1,Yes,"January 1, 1998 to July 23, 2003",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5721,<https://www.scribd.com/document/147736117/Solomon-Islands-Truth-and-Reconciliation-Volume-5> [https://web.archive.org/web/20150828024939/https://pacificpolicy.org/2013/01/solomon-islands-trc-final-report/](https://web.archive.org/web/20150828024939/https:/pacificpolicy.org/2013/01/solomon-islands-trc-final-report/) <https://www.usip.org/publications/2009/04/truth-commission-solomon-islands>,fully independent,Yes,5,"According to the TRC Act, the commissioners were chosen by a consultative process.

209,840,0,The Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission,The Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission,"Armed conflict in Mindanao has had tragic consequences for the Bangsamoro and indigenous peoples and for Filipino society at large. Over the past four decades, an untold number of people in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago have been subjected to immense suffering due to vertical and horizontal violence. They have lost family members; they have been driven from their homes and have lost their lands and livelihoods. Incidents of violent conflict and systematic discrimination and exclusion have become a collective experience and memory. The people of the Bangsamoro are poor and tired and they want peace. At the same time, the Philippines as a nation has not remained unscathed. The prolongation of the armed conflict has generated pockets of malgovernance, violence, and corruption. It has eroded the values of the nation and undermined trust between citizens and the State. On another level, the conflict has cost the Philippines precious time and opportunities. It has effectively hindered decades of potential social and economic development and weakened the quality of democracy and of human security. With the appearance of new armed groups and new forms of violence (e.g., international terrorism and drug-related crime), an environment of multidimensional conflict has begun to take hold in the Philippines. In this context, bringing peace to the Bangsamoro in a durable manner offers a unique opportunity for the Philippines—the opportunity for a modern nation-state to emerge that is capable of managing the diversity of peoples and communities inherent to any modern democracy in a constructive manner based on equality of opportunity and on the rule of law. Similarly, the Bangsamoro aspire to a political framework, which shall enable the practice of good governance, the development of the Bangsamoro region and people, and the possibility for them to proudly assert their identity, and constructively engage with their own multiethnic constituency. The recommendations of the TJRC are elaborated with the intention of opening the path for a joint Bangsamoro and Filipino process of ‘dealing with the past’ that can address both the root causes of the conflict and their consequences, while building on the extraordinary Bangsamoro and Filipino capacity for resilience.",domestic,domestic law,President Benigno Aquino III,,Final Report TJRC Phillipines,2010,2010-07-30,https://lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo2010/eo\_1\_2010.html,completed,0,2010,<https://lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo2010/eo_1_2010.html>,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,no,yes,1,1,1,No,,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,,Final Report TJRC 2016,fully independent,Yes,7,Chosen by President Aquino based on their merits,No,Unknown,,,FInal Report TJRC,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,FInal Report TJRC 2016,Yes,,No,Unknown,Yes,No,,,Final Report TJRC 2016,2016,Yes,The TJRC published a final report,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,0,,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,"Recommend to the President the creation of a National Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission on the Bangsamoro (NTJRCB) that shall oversee and support the operations of four Sub-Commissions named below, ensure the implementation of the ‘dealing with the past’ framework, and promote healing and reconciliation.

225,780,0,Sansoni Commission,Sansoni Commission,"This commission was established to address the problem of inter-ethnic communal violence between Sinhalese and Tamils following the election of PM JR Jayewardene, between August 3 and September 15, 1977. It was headed by a commission named for retired Supreme Court Justice Miliani Claude Sansoni, who was under political pressure not to blame Sinhalese for the violence. The Sansoni report recommended that Tamil victims be compensated for damages. Perpetrators identified in the report were not prosecuted. Instead, in 1982, Parliament passed the Indemnity Act, No 20 of 1982, which prevented legal action of any kind against any representative or employee of the government for any act, “legal or otherwise, done or purported to be done with a view to restoring law and order during the period 1 August 1977; This Act was further amended in December 1988 to extend the relevant period of indemnity to 16 December 1988. There is no doubt that there was tremendous political pressure on Commissioner Sansoni to avoid giving a prejudicial impression of the actions of the Sinhalese political leadership in bringing about the outbreak of communal violence. One commentary points to obstacles faced by the Commission in its functioning as when the Police Information Books in Kandy were not furnished to it, purportedly on grounds of national security and the Commission faced threats during its sittings. Unsurprisingly, these obstacles are not publicly recorded and were deniedin later years. The report put most of the blame for violence on the Tamil political leadership, and discounted significant witness testimony that implicated the state (although it reported the allegations). A few police officers were mentioned by Sansoni as bearing responsibility but no action, either disciplinary or prosecutorial, was taken against them. M.C. Sansoni did acknowledge police failures to protect civilians and to prevent violence, and identified few police officers who had instigated or participated in violence against Tamils.",domestic,domestic law,President William Gopallawa,,Amnesty International. 2009. _Twenty Years of Make-Believe: Sri Lanka’s Commissions of Inquiry_. <https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa37/005/2009/en/>_ _ _ _ <https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-reality-beneath-the-sansoni-report/> <https://www.sundaytimes.lk/101024/Columns/focus.html> <https://www.lankaweb.com/news/items/2015/07/02/sri-lanka-must-republish-sansoni-report-expose-tamil-separatist-mentality/>,1977,,,completed,0,1977,,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,,,0,1,1,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,,,partially independent,Yes,1,Appointment by PM,No,Unknown,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,Yes,,No,No,Unknown,Unknown,,,,1980,Yes,,No,,,,Yes,0,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,No,,,0,,,,,,,executive,reparation; coexistence; non-recurrence,,,,,,,,,2024-01-25
